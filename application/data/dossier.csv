"Investigating Explanations in Conditional and Highly Automated Driving:
  The Effects of Situation Awareness and Modality"	Lilit Avetisyan	Jackie Ayoub, Feng Zhou	2022-07-15 14:30:15	With the level of automation increases in vehicles, such as conditional and highly automated vehicles (AVs), drivers are becoming increasingly out of the control loop, especially in unexpected driving scenarios. Although it might be not necessary to require the drivers to intervene on most occasions, it is still important to improve drivers' situation awareness (SA) in unexpected driving scenarios to improve their trust in and acceptance of AVs. In this study, we conceptualized SA at the levels of perception (SA L1), comprehension (SA L2), and projection (SA L3), and proposed an SA level-based explanation framework based on explainable AI. Then, we examined the effects of these explanations and their modalities on drivers' situational trust, cognitive workload, as well as explanation satisfaction. A three (SA levels: SA L1, SA L2 and SA L3) by two (explanation modalities: visual, visual + audio) between-subjects experiment was conducted with 340 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results indicated that by designing the explanations using the proposed SA-based framework, participants could redirect their attention to the important objects in the traffic and understand their meaning for the AV system. This improved their SA and filled the gap of understanding the correspondence of AV's behavior in the particular situations which also increased their situational trust in AV. The results showed that participants reported the highest trust with SA L2 explanations, although the mental workload was assessed higher in this level. The results also provided insights into the relationship between the amount of information in explanations and modalities, showing that participants were more satisfied with visual-only explanations in the SA L1 and SA L2 conditions and were more satisfied with visual and auditory explanations in the SA L3 condition.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07496v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Do They Accept or Resist Cybersecurity Measures? Development and
  Validation of the 13-Item Security Attitude Inventory (SA-13)"	Cori Faklaris	Laura Dabbish, Jason I. Hong	2022-04-06 22:14:36	We present SA-13, the 13-item Security Attitude inventory. We develop and validate this assessment of cybersecurity attitudes by conducting an exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and other tests with data from a U.S. Census-weighted Qualtrics panel (N=209). Beyond a core six indicators of Engagement with Security Measures (SA-Engagement, three items) and Attentiveness to Security Measures (SA-Attentiveness, three items), our SA-13 inventory adds indicators of Resistance to Security Measures (SA-Resistance, four items) and Concernedness with Improving Compliance (SA-Concernedness, three items). SA-13 and the subscales exhibit desirable psychometric qualities; and higher scores on SA-13 and on the SA-Engagement and SA-Attentiveness subscales are associated with higher scores for security behavior intention and for self-reported recent security behaviors. SA-13 and the subscales are useful for researchers and security awareness teams who need a lightweight survey measure of user security attitudes. The composite score of the 13 indicators provides a compact measurement of cybersecurity decisional balance.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03114v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Decentralized Spectrum Access System: Vision, Challenges, and a
  Blockchain Solution"	Yang Xiao	Shanghao Shi, Wenjing Lou, Chonggang Wang, Xu Li, Ning Zhang, Y. Thomas Hou, Jeffrey H. Reed	2021-12-10 15:47:54	Spectrum access system (SAS) is widely considered the de facto solution to coordinating dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) and protecting incumbent users. The current SAS paradigm prescribed by the FCC for the CBRS band and standardized by the WInnForum follows a centralized service model in that a spectrum user subscribes to a SAS server for spectrum allocation service. This model, however, neither tolerates SAS server failures (crash or Byzantine) nor resists dishonest SAS administrators, leading to serious concerns on SAS system reliability and trustworthiness. This is especially concerning for the evolving DSS landscape where an increasing number of SAS service providers and heterogeneous user requirements are coming up. To address these challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized SAS architecture called BD-SAS that provides SAS services securely and efficiently, without relying on the trust of each individual SAS server for the overall system trustworthiness. In BD-SAS, a global blockchain (G-Chain) is used for spectrum regulatory compliance while smart contract-enabled local blockchains (L-Chains) are instantiated in individual spectrum zones for automating spectrum access assignment per user request. We hope our vision of a decentralized SAS, the BD-SAS architecture, and discussion on future challenges can open up a new direction towards reliable spectrum management in a decentralized manner.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MWC.101.2100354	cs	arxiv					0.0	
ULA Fitting for Sparse Array Design	Wanlu Shi	Sergiy A. Vorobyov, Yingsong Li	2021-02-05 03:50:13	Sparse array (SA) geometries, such as coprime and nested arrays, can be regarded as a concatenation of two uniform linear arrays (ULAs). Such arrays lead to a significant increase of the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) when the second-order information is utilized, i.e., they provide long virtual difference coarray (DCA). Thus, the idea of this paper is based on the observation that SAs can be fitted through concatenation of sub-ULAs. A corresponding SA design principle, called ULA fitting, is then proposed. It aims to design SAs from sub-ULAs. Towards this goal, a polynomial model for arrays is used, and based on it, a DCA structure is analyzed if SA is composed of multiple sub-ULAs. SA design with low mutual coupling is considered. ULA fitting enables to transfer the SA design requirements, such as hole free, low mutual coupling and other requirements, into pseudo polynomial equation, and hence, find particular solutions. We mainly focus on designing SAs with low mutual coupling and large uniform DOF. Two examples of SAs with closed-form expressions are then developed based on ULA fitting. Numerical experiments verify the superiority of the proposed SAs in the presence of heavy mutual coupling.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3125609	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Multi-view SA-LA Net: A framework for simultaneous segmentation of RV on
  multi-view cardiac MR Images"	Sana Jabbar	Syed Talha Bukhari, Hassan Mohy-ud-Din	2021-10-01 23:26:51	We proposed a multi-view SA-LA model for simultaneous segmentation of RV on the short-axis (SA) and long-axis (LA) cardiac MR images. The multi-view SA-LA model is a multi-encoder, multi-decoder U-Net architecture based on the U-Net model. One encoder-decoder pair segments the RV on SA images and the other pair on LA images. Multi-view SA-LA model assembles an extremely rich set of synergistic features, at the root of the encoder branch, by combining feature maps learned from matched SA and LA cardiac MR images. Segmentation performance is further enhanced by: (1) incorporating spatial context of LV as a prior and (2) performing deep supervision in the last three layers of the decoder branch. Multi-view SA-LA model was extensively evaluated on the MICCAI 2021 Multi- Disease, Multi-View, and Multi- Centre RV Segmentation Challenge dataset (M&Ms-2021). M&Ms-2021 dataset consists of multi-phase, multi-view cardiac MR images of 360 subjects acquired at four clinical centers with three different vendors. On the challenge cohort (160 subjects), the proposed multi-view SA-LA model achieved a Dice Score of 91% and Hausdorff distance of 11.2 mm on short-axis images and a Dice Score of 89.6% and Hausdorff distance of 8.1 mm on long-axis images. Moreover, multi-view SA-LA model exhibited strong generalization to unseen RV related pathologies including Dilated Right Ventricle (DSC: SA 91.41%, LA 89.63%) and Tricuspidal Regurgitation (DSC: SA 91.40%, LA 90.40%) with low variance (std_DSC: SA <5%, LA<6%).	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00682v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Software Analytics to Software Domains: A Systematic Literature Review	Tamer Mohamed Abdelltif	Luiz Fernando Capretz, Danny Ho	2015-11-12 22:06:58	Software Analytics (SA) is a new branch of big data analytics that has recently emerged (2011). What distinguishes SA from direct software analysis is that it links data mined from many different software artifacts to obtain valuable insights. These insights are useful for the decision-making process throughout the different phases of the software lifecycle. Since SA is currently a hot and promising topic, we have conducted a systematic literature review, presented in this paper, to identify gaps in knowledge and open research areas in SA. Because many researchers are still confused about the true potential of SA, we had to filter out available research papers to obtain the most SA-relevant work for our review. This filtration yielded 19 studies out of 135. We have based our systematic review on four main factors: which software practitioners SA targets, which domains are covered by SA, which artifacts are extracted by SA, and whether these artifacts are linked or not. The results of our review have shown that much of the available SA research only serves the needs of developers. Also, much of the available research uses only one artifact which, in turn, means fewer links between artifacts and fewer insights. This shows that the available SA research work is still embryonic leaving plenty of room for future research in the SA field.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.14	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Decomposability for stable processes	Yizao Wang	Stilian A. Stoev, Parthanil Roy	2011-05-09 19:55:12	We characterize all possible independent symmetric alpha-stable (SaS) components of an SaS process, 0<alpha<2. In particular, we focus on stationary SaS processes and their independent stationary SaS components. We also develop a parallel characterization theory for max-stable processes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1765v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Review of Situation Awareness Assessment Approaches in Aviation
  Environments"	Thanh Nguyen	Chee Peng Lim, Ngoc Duy Nguyen, Lee Gordon-Brown, Saeid Nahavandi	2018-03-06 11:17:12	Situation awareness (SA) is an important constituent in human information processing and essential in pilots' decision-making processes. Acquiring and maintaining appropriate levels of SA is critical in aviation environments as it affects all decisions and actions taking place in flights and air traffic control. This paper provides an overview of recent measurement models and approaches to establishing and enhancing SA in aviation environments. Many aspects of SA are examined including the classification of SA techniques into six categories, and different theoretical SA models from individual, to shared or team, and to distributed or system levels. Quantitative and qualitative perspectives pertaining to SA methods and issues of SA for unmanned vehicles are also addressed. Furthermore, future research directions regarding SA assessment approaches are raised to deal with shortcomings of the existing state-of-the-art methods in the literature.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2918283	cs	arxiv					0.0	
How Can Self-Attention Networks Recognize Dyck-n Languages?	Javid Ebrahimi	Dhruv Gelda, Wei Zhang	2020-10-09 00:03:17	We focus on the recognition of Dyck-n ($\mathcal{D}_n$) languages with self-attention (SA) networks, which has been deemed to be a difficult task for these networks. We compare the performance of two variants of SA, one with a starting symbol (SA$^+$) and one without (SA$^-$). Our results show that SA$^+$ is able to generalize to longer sequences and deeper dependencies. For $\mathcal{D}_2$, we find that SA$^-$ completely breaks down on long sequences whereas the accuracy of SA$^+$ is 58.82$\%$. We find attention maps learned by $\text{SA}{^+}$ to be amenable to interpretation and compatible with a stack-based language recognizer. Surprisingly, the performance of SA networks is at par with LSTMs, which provides evidence on the ability of SA to learn hierarchies without recursion.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04303v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Minimum Bayes Risk Training for End-to-End Speaker-Attributed ASR	Naoyuki Kanda	Zhong Meng, Liang Lu, Yashesh Gaur, Xiaofei Wang, Zhuo Chen, Takuya Yoshioka	2020-11-03 22:28:57	Recently, an end-to-end speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (E2E SA-ASR) model was proposed as a joint model of speaker counting, speech recognition and speaker identification for monaural overlapped speech. In the previous study, the model parameters were trained based on the speaker-attributed maximum mutual information (SA-MMI) criterion, with which the joint posterior probability for multi-talker transcription and speaker identification are maximized over training data. Although SA-MMI training showed promising results for overlapped speech consisting of various numbers of speakers, the training criterion was not directly linked to the final evaluation metric, i.e., speaker-attributed word error rate (SA-WER). In this paper, we propose a speaker-attributed minimum Bayes risk (SA-MBR) training method where the parameters are trained to directly minimize the expected SA-WER over the training data. Experiments using the LibriSpeech corpus show that the proposed SA-MBR training reduces the SA-WER by 9.0 % relative compared with the SA-MMI-trained model.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02921v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Using Eye-tracking Data to Predict Situation Awareness in Real Time
  during Takeover Transitions in Conditionally Automated Driving"	Feng Zhou	X. Jessie Yang, Joost de Winter	2021-03-27 02:42:41	Situation awareness (SA) is critical to improving takeover performance during the transition period from automated driving to manual driving. Although many studies measured SA during or after the driving task, few studies have attempted to predict SA in real time in automated driving. In this work, we propose to predict SA during the takeover transition period in conditionally automated driving using eye-tracking and self-reported data. First, a tree ensemble machine learning model, named LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), was used to predict SA. Second, in order to understand what factors influenced SA and how, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values of individual predictor variables in the LightGBM model were calculated. These SHAP values explained the prediction model by identifying the most important factors and their effects on SA, which further improved the model performance of LightGBM through feature selection. We standardized SA between 0 and 1 by aggregating three performance measures (i.e., placement, distance, and speed estimation of vehicles with regard to the ego-vehicle) of SA in recreating simulated driving scenarios, after 33 participants viewed 32 videos with six lengths between 1 and 20 s. Using only eye-tracking data, our proposed model outperformed other selected machine learning models, having a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.121, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.096, and a 0.719 correlation coefficient between the predicted SA and the ground truth. The code is available at https://github.com/refengchou/Situation-awareness-prediction. Our proposed model provided important implications on how to monitor and predict SA in real time in automated driving using eye-tracking data.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14792v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Self-adjoint differential operators assosiated with self-adjoint
  differential expressions"	B. L. Voronov	D. M. Gitman, I. V. Tyutin	2006-03-21 21:24:39	Considerable attention has been recently focused on quantum-mechanical systems with boundaries and/or singular potentials for which the construction of physical observables as self-adjoint (s.a.) operators is a nontrivial problem. We present a comparative review of various methods of specifying ordinary s.a. differential operators generated by formally s.a. differential expressions based on the general theory of s.a. extensions of symmetric operators. The exposition is untraditional and is based on the concept of asymmetry forms generated by adjoint operators. The main attention is given to a specification of s.a. extensions by s.a. boundary conditions. All the methods are illustrated by examples of quantum-mechanical observables like momentum and Hamiltonian. In addition to the conventional methods, we propose a possible alternative way of specifying s.a. differential operators by explicit s.a. boundary conditions that generally have an asymptotic form for singular boundaries. A comparative advantage of the method is that it allows avoiding an evaluation of deficient subspaces and deficiency indices. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by a number of examples of quantum-mechanical observables.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0603187v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Coupling Rendering and Generative Adversarial Networks for Artificial
  SAS Image Generation"	Albert Reed	Isaac Gerg, John McKay, Daniel Brown, David Williams, Suren Jayasuriya	2019-09-13 20:30:17	Acquisition of Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) datasets is bottlenecked by the costly deployment of SAS imaging systems, and even when data acquisition is possible,the data is often skewed towards containing barren seafloor rather than objects of interest. We present a novel pipeline, called SAS GAN, which couples an optical renderer with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize realistic SAS images of targets on the seafloor. This coupling enables high levels of SAS image realism while enabling control over image geometry and parameters. We demonstrate qualitative results by presenting examples of images created with our pipeline. We also present quantitative results through the use of t-SNE and the Fr\'echet Inception Distance to argue that our generated SAS imagery potentially augments SAS datasets more effectively than an off-the-shelf GAN.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06436v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Representation of Group Isomorphisms I	Marita Ferrer	Margarita Gary, Salvador Hernández	2018-11-27 11:09:13	Let $G$ be a metric group and let $\sA ut(G)$ denote the automorphism group of $G$. If $\sA$ and $\sB$ are groups of $G$-valued maps defined on the sets $X$ and $Y$, respectively, we say that $\sA$ and $\sB$ are \emph{equivalent} if there is a group isomorphism $H\colon\sA\to\sB$ such that there is a bijective map $h\colon Y\to X$ and a map $w\colon Y\to \sA ut (G)$ satisfying $Hf(y)=w[y](f(h(y)))$ for all $y\in Y$ and $f\in \sA$. In this case, we say that $H$ is represented as a \emph{weighted composition operator}. A group isomorphism $H$ defined between $\sA$ and $\sB$ is called \emph{separating} when for each pair of maps $f,g\in \sA$ satisfying that $f^{-1}(e_G)\cup g^{-1}(e_G)=X$, it holds that $(Hf)^{-1}(e_G)\cup (Hg)^{-1}(e_G)=Y$. Our main result establishes that under some mild conditions, every separating group isomorphism can be represented as a weighted composition operator. As a consequence we establish the equivalence of two function groups if there is a biseparating isomorphism defined between them.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10912v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Review and Refinement of Surprise Adequacy	Michael Weiss	Rwiddhi Chakraborty, Paolo Tonella	2021-03-10 08:56:04	Surprise Adequacy (SA) is one of the emerging and most promising adequacy criteria for Deep Learning (DL) testing. As an adequacy criterion, it has been used to assess the strength of DL test suites. In addition, it has also been used to find inputs to a Deep Neural Network (DNN) which were not sufficiently represented in the training data, or to select samples for DNN retraining. However, computation of the SA metric for a test suite can be prohibitively expensive, as it involves a quadratic number of distance calculations. Hence, we developed and released a performance-optimized, but functionally equivalent, implementation of SA, reducing the evaluation time by up to 97\%. We also propose refined variants of the SA omputation algorithm, aiming to further increase the evaluation speed. We then performed an empirical study on MNIST, focused on the out-of-distribution detection capabilities of SA, which allowed us to reproduce parts of the results presented when SA was first released. The experiments show that our refined variants are substantially faster than plain SA, while producing comparable outcomes. Our experimental results exposed also an overlooked issue of SA: it can be highly sensitive to the non-determinism associated with the DNN training procedure.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05939v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Frozen natural orbitals for the state-averaged driven similarity
  renormalization group"	Chenyang Li	Shuxian Mao, Renke Huang, Francesco A. Evangelista	2023-12-12 06:45:05	We present a reduced-cost implementation of the state-averaged driven similarity renormalization group (SA-DSRG) based on the frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach. The natural orbitals (NOs) are obtained by diagonalizing the one-body reduced density matrix from SA-DSRG second-order perturbation theory (SA-DSRG-PT2). Subsequently, the virtual NOs with occupation numbers (ONs) smaller than a user-defined threshold are excluded from the high-level electron correlation treatment beyond SA-DSRG-PT2. An additive second-order correction is applied to the SA-DSRG Hamiltonian to reintroduce the correlation effect from the discarded orbitals. The FNO SA-DSRG method is benchmarked on 35 small organic molecules in the QUEST database. When keeping 98-99% of the cumulative ONs, the mean absolute error in the vertical transition energies due to FNO is less than 0.01 eV. Using the same FNO threshold, we observe a speedup of 9 times the conventional SA-DSRG implementation for nickel carbonyl with a quadruple-$\zeta$ basis set. The FNO approach enables third-order SA-DSRG perturbation theory computations on chloroiron corrole [FeCl(C$_{19}$H$_{11}$N$_4$)] with more than 1000 basis functions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07008v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Pagsusuri ng RNN-based Transfer Learning Technique sa Low-Resource
  Language"	Dan John Velasco	Aucun	2020-10-13 15:06:07	Low-resource languages such as Filipino suffer from data scarcity which makes it challenging to develop NLP applications for Filipino language. The use of Transfer Learning (TL) techniques alleviates this problem in low-resource setting. In recent years, transformer-based models are proven to be effective in low-resource tasks but faces challenges in accessibility due to its high compute and memory requirements. For this reason, there's a need for a cheaper but effective alternative. This paper has three contributions. First, release a pre-trained AWD-LSTM language model for Filipino language. Second, benchmark AWD-LSTM in the Hate Speech classification task and show that it performs on par with transformer-based models. Third, analyze the the performance of AWD-LSTM in low-resource setting using degradation test and compare it with transformer-based models.   -----   Ang mga low-resource languages tulad ng Filipino ay gipit sa accessible na datos kaya't mahirap gumawa ng mga applications sa wikang ito.

Sa mga nagdaang taon, nanaig ang mga transformer-based TL techniques pagdating sa low-resource tasks ngunit ito ay mataas na compute and memory requirements kaya nangangailangan ng mas mura pero epektibong alternatibo.

Sherali-Adams and the binary encoding of combinatorial principles	Stefan Dantchev	Abdul Ghani, Barnaby Martin	2019-11-01 14:30:32	We consider the Sherali-Adams (SA) refutation system together with the unusual binary encoding of certain combinatorial principles. For the unary encoding of the Pigeonhole Principle and the Least Number Principle, it is known that linear rank is required for refutations in SA, although both admit refutations of polynomial size. We prove that the binary encoding of the Pigeonhole Principle requires exponentially-sized SA refutations, whereas the binary encoding of the Least Number Principle admits logarithmic rank, polynomially-sized SA refutations. We continue by considering a refutation system between SA and Lasserre (Sum-of-Squares). In this system, the Least Number Principle requires linear rank while the Pigeonhole Principle becomes constant rank.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00403v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Cyclic Stochastic Optimization: Generalizations, Convergence, and
  Applications in Multi-Agent Systems"	Karla Hernández Cuevas	Aucun	2017-07-20 20:37:19	Stochastic approximation (SA) is a powerful class of iterative algorithms for nonlinear root-finding that can be used for minimizing a loss function, $L(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, with respect to a parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, when only noisy observations of $L(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ or its gradient are available (through the natural connection between root-finding and minimization); SA algorithms can be thought of as stochastic line search methods where the entire parameter vector is updated at each iteration. The cyclic approach to SA is a variant of SA procedures where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is divided into multiple subvectors that are updated one at a time in a cyclic manner. This dissertation focuses on studying the asymptotic properties of cyclic SA and of the generalized cyclic SA (GCSA) algorithm, a variant of cyclic SA where the subvector to update may be selected according to a random variable or according to a predetermined pattern, and where the noisy update direction can be based on the updates of any SA algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient, Kiefer--Wolfowitz, or simultaneous perturbation SA). The convergence of GCSA, asymptotic normality of GCSA (related to rate of convergence), and efficiency of GCSA relative to its non-cyclic counterpart are investigated both analytically and numerically. Specifically, conditions are obtained for the convergence with probability one of the GCSA iterates and for the asymptotic normality of the normalized iterates of a special case of GCSA. Further, an analytic expression is given for the asymptotic relative efficiency (when efficiency is defined in terms of mean squared error) between a special case of GCSA and its non-cyclic counterpart. Finally, an application of the cyclic SA scheme to a multi-agent stochastic optimization problem is investigated. This dissertation also contains two appendices.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06700v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Speech Act Classifier for Persian Texts and its Application in
  Identifying Rumors"	Zoleikha Jahanbakhsh-Nagadeh	Mohammad-Reza Feizi-Derakhshi, Arash Sharifi	2019-01-12 21:54:23	Speech Acts (SAs) are one of the important areas of pragmatics, which give us a better understanding of the state of mind of the people and convey an intended language function. Knowledge of the SA of a text can be helpful in analyzing that text in natural language processing applications. This study presents a dictionary-based statistical technique for Persian SA recognition. The proposed technique classifies a text into seven classes of SA based on four criteria: lexical, syntactic, semantic, and surface features. WordNet as the tool for extracting synonym and enriching features dictionary is utilized. To evaluate the proposed technique, we utilized four classification methods including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method using RF and SVM as the best classifiers achieved a state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 0.95 for classification of Persian SAs. Our original vision of this work is introducing an application of SA recognition on social media content, especially the common SA in rumors. Therefore, the proposed system utilized to determine the common SAs in rumors. The results showed that Persian rumors are often expressed in three SA classes including narrative, question, and threat, and in some cases with the request SA.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03904v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"An Overview of Advances in Signal Processing Techniques for Classical
  and Quantum Wideband Synthetic Apertures"	Peter Vouras	Kumar Vijay Mishra, Alexandra Artusio-Glimpse, Samuel Pinilla, Angeliki Xenaki, David W. Griffith, Karen Egiazarian	2022-05-11 16:19:04	Rapid developments in synthetic aperture (SA) systems, which generate a larger aperture with greater angular resolution than is inherently possible from the physical dimensions of a single sensor alone, are leading to novel research avenues in several signal processing applications. The SAs may either use a mechanical positioner to move an antenna through space or deploy a distributed network of sensors. With the advent of new hardware technologies, the SAs tend to be denser nowadays. The recent opening of higher frequency bands has led to wide SA bandwidths. In general, new techniques and setups are required to harness the potential of wide SAs in space and bandwidth. Herein, we provide a brief overview of emerging signal processing trends in such spatially and spectrally wideband SA systems. This guide is intended to aid newcomers in navigating the most critical issues in SA analysis and further supports the development of new theories in the field. In particular, we cover the theoretical framework and practical underpinnings of wideband SA radar, channel sounding, sonar, radiometry, and optical applications. Apart from the classical SA applications, we also discuss the quantum electric-field-sensing probes in SAs that are currently undergoing active research but remain at nascent stages of development.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2023.3262443	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Using Deep Neural Networks to Automate Large Scale Statistical Analysis
  for Big Data Applications"	Rongrong Zhang	Wei Deng, Michael Yu Zhu	2017-08-09 22:34:36	Statistical analysis (SA) is a complex process to deduce population properties from analysis of data. It usually takes a well-trained analyst to successfully perform SA, and it becomes extremely challenging to apply SA to big data applications. We propose to use deep neural networks to automate the SA process. In particular, we propose to construct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform automatic model selection and parameter estimation, two most important SA tasks. We refer to the resulting CNNs as the neural model selector and the neural model estimator, respectively, which can be properly trained using labeled data systematically generated from candidate models. Simulation study shows that both the selector and estimator demonstrate excellent performances. The idea and proposed framework can be further extended to automate the entire SA process and have the potential to revolutionize how SA is performed in big data analytics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03027v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Power System Simulation Using the Differential Transformation Method	Yang Liu	Kai Sun	2018-02-12 15:46:52	This paper proposes a new semi-analytical approach for online time-domain power system simulation. The approach applies the differential transformation method (DTM) to the power system differential equation model to offline derive a semi-analytical solution (SAS) having symbolic variables about time, the initial state and system conditions. When simulation is online needed for a contingency under the current system condition, the SAS can be evaluated in real time to generate simulation results. Compared to the Adomian decomposition method in obtaining a power system SAS, an SAS derived by the DTM adopts a recursive form to avoid generating and storing its complete symbolic expression, which makes both derivation and evaluation of the SAS more efficient especially for multi-machine power systems. The optimal order of a DTM-based SAS is studied for the best time performance of simulation. The paper also designs a parallel computing strategy for power system simulation using the DTM-based SAS. Tests on the IEEE 10-machine 39-bus system demonstrate significant speedup of simulation using the proposed approach compared with the Runge-Kutta method.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04134v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Malenfant, Sarah Malek, Sengwee Toh	2018-08-07 14:12:46	Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility and value of conducting distributed regression analysis (DRA), a privacy-protecting analytic method that performs multivariable-adjusted regression analysis with only summary-level information from participating sites. To our knowledge, there are no DRA applications in SAS, the statistical software used by several large national distributed data networks (DDNs), including the Sentinel System and PCORnet.

"Analytical Gradient Theory for Spin-Free State-Averaged Second-Order
  Driven Similarity Renormalization Group Perturbation Theory (SA-DSRG-MRPT2)
  and Its Applications for Conical Intersection Optimizations"	Jae Woo Park	Aucun	2021-11-14 06:16:37	The second-order multireference driven similarity renormalization group perturbation theory (DSRG-MRPT2) theory provides an efficient means of correcting the dynamical correlation with the multiconfiguration reference function. The state-averaged DSRG-MRPT2 (SA-DSRG-MRPT2) method is the simplest means of treating the excited states with DSRG-MRPT2. In this method, the Hamiltonian dressed with dynamical correlation is diagonalized in the CASCI state subspace (SA-DSRG-MRPT2c) or the configuration subspace (SA-DSRG-MRPT2). This work develops the analytical gradient theory for spin-free SA-DSRG-MRPT2(c) with the density-fitting (DF) approximation. We check the accuracy of the analytical gradients against the numerical gradients. We present applications for optimizing minimum energy conical intersections (MECI) of ethylene and retinal model chromophores (PSB3 and RPSB6). We investigate the dependence of the optimized geometries and energies on the flow parameter and reference relaxations. The smoothness of the SA-DSRG-MRPT2(c) potential energy surfaces near the reference (CASSCF) MECI is comparable to the XMCQDPT2 one. These results render the SA-DSRG-MRPT2(c) theory a promising approach for studies of conical intersections.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07253v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Implicit Neural Representations for Deconvolving SAS Images	Albert Reed	Thomas Blanford, Daniel C. Brown, Suren Jayasuriya	2021-12-16 00:24:18	Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) image resolution is constrained by waveform bandwidth and array geometry. Specifically, the waveform bandwidth determines a point spread function (PSF) that blurs the locations of point scatterers in the scene. In theory, deconvolving the reconstructed SAS image with the scene PSF restores the original distribution of scatterers and yields sharper reconstructions. However, deconvolution is an ill-posed operation that is highly sensitive to noise. In this work, we leverage implicit neural representations (INRs), shown to be strong priors for the natural image space, to deconvolve SAS images. Importantly, our method does not require training data, as we perform our deconvolution through an analysis-bysynthesis optimization in a self-supervised fashion. We validate our method on simulated SAS data created with a point scattering model and real data captured with an in-air circular SAS. This work is an important first step towards applying neural networks for SAS image deconvolution.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08539v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Predicting solution scattering patterns with explicit-solvent molecular
  simulations"	Leonie Chatzimagas	Jochen S. Hub	2022-04-11 09:16:59	Small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS/SAS) is widely used to obtain structural information on biomolecules or soft-matter complexes in solution. Deriving a molecular interpretation of the scattering signals requires methods for predicting SAS patterns from a given atomistic structural model. Such SAS predictions are non-trivial because the patterns are influenced by the hydration layer of the solute, the excluded solvent, and by thermal fluctuations. Many computationally efficient methods use simplified, implicit models for the hydration layer and excluded solvent, leading to some uncertainties and to free parameters that require fitting against experimental data. SAS predictions based on explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations overcome such limitations at the price of an increased computational cost. To rationalize the need for explicit-solvent methods, we first review the approximations underlying implicit-solvent methods. Next, we describe the theory behind explicit-solvent SAS predictions that are easily accessible via the WAXSiS web server. We present the workflow for computing SAS pattern from a given molecular dynamics trajectory with a freely available via a modified version of the GROMACS simulations software, coined GROMACS-SWAXS, which implements the WAXSiS method. Practical considerations for running routine explicit-solvent SAS predictions are discussed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04961v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Linear stability analysis via simulated annealing and accelerated
  relaxation"	M. Furukawa	P. J. Morrison	2022-05-29 09:03:04	Simulated annealing (SA) is a kind of relaxation method for finding equilibria of Hamiltonian systems. A set of evolution equations is solved with SA, which is derived from the original Hamiltonian system so that the energy of the system changes monotonically while preserving Casimir invariants inherent to noncanonical Hamiltonian systems. The energy extremum reached by SA is an equilibrium. Since SA searches for an energy extremum, it can also be used for stability analysis when initiated from a state where a perturbation is added to an equilibrium. The procedure of the stability analysis is explained, and some examples are shown. Because the time evolution is computationally time consuming, efficient relaxation is necessary for SA to be practically useful. An acceleration method is developed by introducing time dependence in the symmetric kernel used in the double bracket, which is part of the SA formulation described here. An explicit formulation for low-beta reduced magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in cylindrical geometry is presented. Since SA for low-beta reduced MHD has two advection fields that relax, it is important to balance the orders of magnitude of these advection fields.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0101095	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Case for Asymmetric Systolic Array Floorplanning	C. Peltekis	D. Filippas, G. Dimitrakopoulos, C. Nicopoulos	2023-09-06 13:08:36	The widespread proliferation of deep learning applications has triggered the need to accelerate them directly in hardware. General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) kernels are elemental deep-learning constructs and they inherently map onto Systolic Arrays (SAs). SAs are regular structures that are well-suited for accelerating matrix multiplications. Typical SAs use a pipelined array of Processing Elements (PEs), which communicate with local connections and pre-orchestrated data movements. In this work, we show that the physical layout of SAs should be asymmetric to minimize wirelength and improve energy efficiency. The floorplan of the SA adjusts better to the asymmetric widths of the horizontal and vertical data buses and their switching activity profiles. It is demonstrated that such physically asymmetric SAs reduce interconnect power by 9.1% when executing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, as compared to SAs of the same size but with a square (i.e., symmetric) layout. The savings in interconnect power translate, in turn, to 2.1% overall power savings.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02969v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Study of Enhanced MISC-Based Sparse Arrays with High uDOFs and Low
  Mutual Coupling"	X. Sheng	D. Lu, Y. Li, R. C. de Lamare	2023-09-16 16:50:38	In this letter, inspired by the maximum inter-element spacing (IES) constraint (MISC) criterion, an enhanced MISC-based (EMISC) sparse array (SA) with high uniform degrees-of-freedom (uDOFs) and low mutual-coupling (MC) is proposed, analyzed and discussed in detail. For the EMISC SA, an IES set is first determined by the maximum IES and number of elements. Then, the EMISC SA is composed of seven uniform linear sub-arrays (ULSAs) derived from an IES set. An analysis of the uDOFs and weight function shows that, the proposed EMISC SA outperforms the IMISC SA in terms of uDOF and MC. Simulation results show a significant advantage of the EMISC SA over other existing SAs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09044v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Secure and Authenticated Key Management Protocol (SA-KMP) for
  Vehicular Networks"	Hengchuan Tan	Maode Ma, Houda Labiod, Aymen Boudguiga, Jun Zhang, Peter Han Joo Chong	2017-12-28 13:55:54	Public key infrastructure (PKI) is the most widely used security mechanism for securing communications over the network. However, there are known performance issues, making it unsuitable for use in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and authenticated key management protocol (SA-KMP) to overcome the shortcomings of the PKI. The SA-KMP scheme distributes repository containing the bindings of the en-tity's identity and its corresponding public key to each vehicle and road side unit. By doing so, certificate exchanges and certificate revocation lists are eliminated. Furthermore, the SA-KMP scheme uses symmetric keys derived based on a 3-D-matrix-based key agreement scheme to reduce the high computational costs of using asymmetric cryptography. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SA-KMP through performance evaluations in terms of transmission and storage overhead, network latency, and key generation time. Analytical results show that the SA-KMP is more scalable and outperforms the certificate-based PKI. Simulation results indicate that the key generation time of the SA-KMP scheme is less than that of the existing Elliptic Curve Diffie--Hellman and Diffie--Hellman protocols. In addition, we use Proverif to prove that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against an active attacker under the Dolev and Yao model and further show that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against denial of service, collusion attacks, and a wide range of other malicious attacks.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2621354	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Multi-label classification: do Hamming loss and subset accuracy really
  conflict with each other?"	Guoqiang Wu	Jun Zhu	2020-11-16 09:13:16	Various evaluation measures have been developed for multi-label classification, including Hamming Loss (HL), Subset Accuracy (SA) and Ranking Loss (RL). However, there is a gap between empirical results and the existing theories: 1) an algorithm often empirically performs well on some measure(s) while poorly on others, while a formal theoretical analysis is lacking; and 2) in small label space cases, the algorithms optimizing HL often have comparable or even better performance on the SA measure than those optimizing SA directly, while existing theoretical results show that SA and HL are conflicting measures. This paper provides an attempt to fill up this gap by analyzing the learning guarantees of the corresponding learning algorithms on both SA and HL measures. We show that when a learning algorithm optimizes HL with its surrogate loss, it enjoys an error bound for the HL measure independent of $c$ (the number of labels), while the bound for the SA measure depends on at most $O(c)$. On the other hand, when directly optimizing SA with its surrogate loss, it has learning guarantees that depend on $O(\sqrt{c})$ for both HL and SA measures. This explains the observation that when the label space is not large, optimizing HL with its surrogate loss can have promising performance for SA. We further show that our techniques are applicable to analyze the learning guarantees of algorithms on other measures, such as RL. Finally, the theoretical analyses are supported by experimental results.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07805v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Relationships between Software Architecture and Source Code in Practice:
  An Exploratory Survey and Interview"	Fangchao Tian	Peng Liang, Muhammad Ali Babar	2021-08-02 16:27:35	Context: Software Architecture (SA) and Source Code (SC) are two intertwined artefacts that represent the interdependent design decisions made at different levels of abstractions - High-Level (HL) and Low-Level (LL). An understanding of the relationships between SA and SC is expected to bridge the gap between SA and SC for supporting maintenance and evolution of software systems. Objective: We aimed at exploring practitioners' understanding about the relationships between SA and SC. Method: We used a mixed-method that combines an online survey with 87 respondents and an interview with 8 participants to collect the views of practitioners from 37 countries about the relationships between SA and SC. Results: Our results reveal that: practitioners mainly discuss five features of relationships between SA and SC; a few practitioners have adopted dedicated approaches and tools in the literature for identifying and analyzing the relationships between SA and SC despite recognizing the importance of such information for improving a system's quality attributes, especially maintainability and reliability. It is felt that cost and effort are the major impediments that prevent practitioners from identifying, analyzing, and using the relationships between SA and SC. Conclusions: The results have empirically identified five features of relationships between SA and SC reported in the literature from the perspective of practitioners and a systematic framework to manage the five features of relationships should be developed with dedicated approaches and tools considering the cost and benefit of maintaining the relationships.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01018v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Exploring Sentiment Analysis Techniques in Natural Language Processing:
  A Comprehensive Review"	Karthick Prasad Gunasekaran	Aucun	2023-05-24 07:48:41	Sentiment analysis (SA) is the automated process of detecting and understanding the emotions conveyed through written text. Over the past decade, SA has gained significant popularity in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With the widespread use of social media and online platforms, SA has become crucial for companies to gather customer feedback and shape their marketing strategies. Additionally, researchers rely on SA to analyze public sentiment on various topics. In this particular research study, a comprehensive survey was conducted to explore the latest trends and techniques in SA. The survey encompassed a wide range of methods, including lexicon-based, graph-based, network-based, machine learning, deep learning, ensemble-based, rule-based, and hybrid techniques. The paper also addresses the challenges and opportunities in SA, such as dealing with sarcasm and irony, analyzing multi-lingual data, and addressing ethical concerns. To provide a practical case study, Twitter was chosen as one of the largest online social media platforms. Furthermore, the researchers shed light on the diverse application areas of SA, including social media, healthcare, marketing, finance, and politics. The paper also presents a comparative and comprehensive analysis of existing trends and techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ultimate goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a systematic review of SA techniques, identify existing gaps, and suggest possible improvements. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of SA processes, leading to smoother and error-free outcomes.	http://dx.doi.org/10.17148/IJARCCE.2019.8126	cs	arxiv					0.0

"An efficient implementation of the simulated annealing heuristic for the

One of the most powerful and commonly used heuristics to obtain approximations to the optimal solution of the QAP is simulated annealing (SA).

Stochastic Approximation on Riemannian manifolds	Suhail M. Shah	Aucun	2017-11-29 10:13:01	The standard theory of stochastic approximation (SA) is extended to the case when the constraint set is a Riemannian manifold. Specifically, the standard ODE method for analyzing SA schemes is extended to iterations constrained to stay on a manifold using a retraction mapping. In addition, for submanifolds of a Euclidean space, a framework is developed for a projected SA scheme with approximate retractions. The framework is also extended to non-differentiable constraint sets.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10754v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Extragalactic Objects in Basle Fields	S. Bilir	Y. Karatas, S.

Their numbers are 187, 70, and 93 for Plaut I, SA 54, and SA 82, respectively. Most of these objects are apparently faint in V, and they cause an overestimated local luminosity function for absolutely faint magnitudes, M(V) > 5.

"Monolayer Characteristics of Pyrene Mixed with Stearic Acid at the
  Air-Water Interface"	Md. N. Islam	D. Bhattacharjee, Syed Arshad Hussain	2008-07-16 21:10:15	In the present communication we report the monolayer characteristics of pyrene mixed with stearic acid (SA) at the air-water interface. The monolayer properties are investigated by recording and analyzing the surface pressure-area per molecule isotherm (pi-A) of the pyrene-SA mixed films. It is observed that the pyrene and SA are miscible in the mixed monolayer. This miscibility/nonideality leads to phase separation between the constituent components (pyrene and SA). BAM image of the mixed monolayer confirms the miscibility or nonideal mixing at the mixed monolayer.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218625X08011378	cs	arxiv					0.0

An effective heuristic for obtaining approximate solutions to the QAP is simulated annealing (SA). Here we describe an SA implementation for the QAP which runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU). GPUs are composed of low cost commodity graphics chips which in combination provide a powerful platform for general purpose parallel computing.

Syntax Aware LSTM Model for Chinese Semantic Role Labeling	Feng Qian	Lei Sha, Baobao Chang, Lu-chen Liu, Ming Zhang	2017-04-03 02:10:19	As for semantic role labeling (SRL) task, when it comes to utilizing parsing information, both traditional methods and recent recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods use the feature engineering way. In this paper, we propose Syntax Aware Long Short Time Memory(SA-LSTM). The structure of SA-LSTM modifies according to dependency parsing information in order to model parsing information directly in an architecture engineering way instead of feature engineering way. We experimentally demonstrate that SA-LSTM gains more improvement from the model architecture. Furthermore, SA-LSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art on CPB 1.0 significantly according to Student t-test ($p<0.05$).	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00405v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Theoretical Study and Comparison of SPSA and RDSA Algorithms	Yiwen Chen	Aucun	2021-07-24 05:50:17	Stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms are widely used in system optimization problems when only noisy measurements of the system are available. This paper studies two types of SA algorithms in a multivariate Kiefer-Wolfowitz setting: random-direction SA (RDSA) and simultaneous-perturbation SA (SPSA), and then describes the bias term, convergence, and asymptotic normality of RDSA algorithms. The gradient estimations in RDSA and SPSA have different forms and, consequently, use different types of random perturbations. This paper looks at various valid distributions for perturbations in RDSA and SPSA and then compares the two algorithms using mean-square errors computed from asymptotic distribution. From both a theoretical and numerical point of view, we find that SPSA generally outperforms RDSA.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12771v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Finding Semi-Analytic Solutions of Power System Differential-Algebraic
  Equations for Fast Transient Stability Simulation"	Nan Duan	Kai Sun	2014-12-02 13:28:12	This paper studies the semi-analytic solution (SAS) of a power system's differential-algebraic equation. A SAS is a closed-form function of symbolic variables including time, the initial state and the parameters on system operating conditions, and hence able to directly give trajectories on system state variables, which are accurate for at least a certain time window. A two-stage SAS-based approach for fast transient stability simulation is proposed, which offline derives the SAS by the Adomian Decomposition Method and online evaluates the SAS for each of sequential time windows until making up a desired simulation period. When applied to fault simulation, the new approach employs numerical integration only for the fault-on period to determine the post-disturbance initial state of the SAS. The paper further analyzes the maximum length of a time window for a SAS to keep its accuracy, and accordingly, introduces a divergence indicator for adaptive time windows. The proposed SAS-based new approach is validated on the IEEE 10-machine, 39-bus system.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0904v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Fair Resource Allocation in Optical Networks under Tidal Traffic	Tania Panayiotou	Georgios Ellinas	2020-05-12 15:48:44	We propose an alpha-fair routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) framework for reconfigurable elastic optical networks under modeled tidal traffic, that is based on the maximization of the social welfare function parameterized by a scalar alpha (the inequality aversion parameter). The objective is to approximate an egalitarian spectrum allocation (SA) that maximizes the minimum possible SA over all connections contending for the network resources, shifting from the widely used utilitarian SA that merely maximizes the network efficiency. A set of existing metrics are examined (i.e., connection blocking, resource utilization, coefficient of variation (CV) of utilities), and a set of new measures are also introduced (i.e., improvement on connection over- (COP) and under-provisioning (CUP), CV of unserved traffic), allowing a network operator to derive and evaluate in advance a set of alpha-fair RSA solutions and select the one that best fits the performance requirements of both the individual connections and the overall network. We show that an egalitarian SA better utilizes the network resources by significantly improving both COP (up to 20%) and CUP (up to 80%), compared to the utilitarian allocation, while attaining zero blocking. Importantly, the CVs of utilities and unserved traffic indicate that a SA that is fairest with respect to the amount of utilities allocated to the connections does not imply that the SA is also fairest with respect to the achievable QoS of the connections, while an egalitarian SA better approximates a fairest QoS-based SA.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322381	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The History of Software Architecture - In the Eye of the Practitioner	Henry Muccini	Patricia Lago, Karthik Vaidyanathan, Francesco Osborne, Eltjo Poort	2018-06-11 15:25:14	Software architecture (SA) is celebrating 25 years. This is so if we consider the seminal papers establishing SA as a distinct discipline and scientific publications that have identified cornerstones of both research and practice, like architecture views, architecture description languages, and architecture evaluation. With the pervasive use of cloud provisioning, the dynamic integration of multi-party distributed services, and the steep increase in the digitalization of business and society, making sound design decisions encompasses an increasingly-large and complex problem space. The role of SA is essential as never before, so much so that no organization undertakes `serious' projects without the support of suitable architecture practices. But, how did SA practice evolve in the past 25 years? and What are the challenges ahead? There have been various attempts to summarize the state of research and practice of SA. Still, we miss the practitioners' view on the questions above. To fill this gap, we have first extracted the top-10 topics resulting from the analysis of 5,622 scientific papers. Then, we have used such topics to design an online survey filled out by 57 SA practitioners with 5 to 20+ years of experience. We present the results of the survey with a special focus on the SA topics that SA practitioners perceive, in the past, present and future, as the most impactful. We finally use the results to draw preliminary takeaways.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04055v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Deviation of the Broad-line Region Size Between Reverberation
  Mapping and Spectroastrometry"	Xiaer Zhang	Zhicheng He, Tinggui Wang, Hengxiao Guo	2021-04-23 05:18:50	The combination of the linear size from reverberation mapping (RM) and the angular distance of the broad line region (BLR) from spectroastrometry (SA) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be used to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$. Recently, Wang et al. (2020) successfully employed this approach and estimated $H_0$ from 3C 273. However, there may be a systematic deviation between the response-weighted radius (RM measurement) and luminosity-weighted radius (SA measurement), especially when different broad lines are adopted for size indicators (e.g., \hb\ for RM and \pa\ for SA). Here we evaluate the size deviations measured by six pairs of hydrogen lines (e.g., \hb, \ha\ and \pa) via the locally optimally emitting cloud (LOC) models of BLR. We find that the radius ratios $K$(=$R_{\rm SA}$/$R_{\rm RM}$) of the same line deviated systematically from 1 (0.85-0.88) with dispersions between 0.063-0.083. Surprisingly, the $K$ values from the \pa(SA)/\hb(RM) and \ha(SA)/\hb(RM) pairs not only are closest to 1 but also have considerably smaller uncertainty. Considering the current infrared interferometry technology, the \pa(SA)/\hb(RM) pair is the ideal choice for the low redshift objects in the SARM project. In the future, the \ha(SA)/\hb(RM) pair could be used for the high redshift luminous quasars. These theoretical estimations of the SA/RM radius pave the way for the future SARM measurements to further constrain the standard cosmological model.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/abfb6b	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Novel Full-Polarization SAR Images Ship Detector Based on the
  Scattering Mechanisms and the Wave Polarization Anisotropy"	Chuan Zhang	Gui Gao, Linlin Zhang, C. Chen, S. Gao, Libo Yao, Shiquan Gou	2021-12-06 12:24:12	Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is considered being a good option for earth observation with its unique advantages. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive ship detector using full-polarization SAR images. First, by thoroughly investigating the scattering characteristics between ships and their background, and the wave polarization anisotropy, a novel ship detector is proposed by jointing the two characteristics, named Scattering-Anisotropy joint (joint-SA). Based on the theoretical analysis, we showed that the joint-SA is an effective physical quantity to show the difference between the ship and its background, and thus joint-SA can be used for ship detection of full-polarization image data. Second, the generalized Gamma distribution was used to characterize the joint-SA statistics of sea clutter with a large range of homogeneity. As a result, an adaptive constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method was implemented based on the joint-SA. Finally, RADARSAT-2 and GF-3 data in C-band and ALOS data in L-band are used for verification. We tested on five datasets, and the experimental results verify the correctness and superiority of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method based on the joint-SA. In addition, the experimental results also showed that the signal-clutter ratio (SCR) of the proposed ship detector joint-SA (33.17 dB, 35.98 dB, 57.25 dB) is better than that of DBSP (8.92 dB, 3.43 dB, 25.40 dB) and RsDVH (17.28 dB, 11.17 dB, 54.55 dB). More importantly, the proposed detector joint-SA has higher detection accuracy and a lower false alarm rate.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02965v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A novel deep learning-based approach for sleep apnea detection using
  single-lead ECG signals"	Anh-Tu Nguyen	Thao Nguyen, Huy-Khiem Le, Huy-Hieu Pham, Cuong Do	2022-08-05 23:46:20	Sleep apnea (SA) is a type of sleep disorder characterized by snoring and chronic sleeplessness, which can lead to serious conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy (enlargement of the muscle tissue of the heart). The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a critical role in identifying SA since it might reveal abnormal cardiac activity. Recent research on ECG-based SA detection has focused on feature engineering techniques that extract specific characteristics from multiple-lead ECG signals and use them as classification model inputs. In this study, a novel method of feature extraction based on the detection of S peaks is proposed to enhance the detection of adjacent SA segments using a single-lead ECG. In particular, ECG features collected from a single lead (V2) are used to identify SA episodes. On the extracted features, a CNN model is trained to detect SA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method detects SA from single-lead ECG data is more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods, with 91.13% classification accuracy, 92.58% sensitivity, and 88.75% specificity. Moreover, the further usage of features associated with the S peaks enhances the classification accuracy by 0.85%. Our findings indicate that the proposed machine learning system has the potential to be an effective method for detecting SA episodes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03408v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

Nilpotence, radicaux et structures monoïdales	Yves André	Bruno Kahn, avec un appendice de Peter O'Sullivan	2002-03-26 19:14:31	For $K$ a field, a Wedderburn $K$-linear category is a $K$-linear category $\sA$ whose radical $\sR$ is locally nilpotent and such that $\bar \sA:=\sA/\sR$ is semi-simple and remains so after any extension of scalars. We prove existence and uniqueness results for sections of the projection $\sA\to \bar\sA$, in the vein of the theorems of Wedderburn. There are two such results: one in the general case and one when $\sA$ has a monoidal structure for which $\sR$ is a monoidal ideal. The latter applies notably to Tannakian categories over a field of characteristic zero, and we get a generalisation of the Jacobson-Morozov theorem: the existence of a pro-reductive envelope $\Pred(G)$ associated to any affine group scheme $G$ over $K$. Other applications are given in this paper as well as in a forthcoming one on motives.	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203273v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Operator Segal Algebras in Fourier Algebras	Brian E. Forrest	Nico Spronk, Peter J. Wood	2006-01-20 19:19:07	Let G be a locally compact group, A(G) its Fourier algebra and L1(G) the space of Haar integrable functions on G. We study the Segal algebra SA(G)=A(G)\cap L1(G) in A(G). It admits an operator space structure which makes it a completely contractive Banach algebra. We compute the dual space of SA(G). We use it show that restriction operator u|->u|H:SA(G)->A(H), for some non-open closed subgroups H, is a surjective complete qutient map. We also show that if N is a non-compact closed subgroup, then the averaging operator tau_N:SA(G)->L1(G/N), tau_N u(sN)=\int_N u(sn)dn is a surjective complete quotient map. This puts an operator space perspective on the philosophy that SA(G) is ``locally A(G) while globally L1''. Also, using the operator space structure we can show that SA(G) is operator amenable exactly when when G is compact; and we can show that it is always operator weakly amenable. To obtain the latter fact, we use E. Samei's theory of hyper-Tauberian Banach algebras.	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0601509v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Operator Imprecision and Scaling of Shor's Algorithm	C. Ray Hill	George F. Viamontes	2008-04-18 17:59:35	Shor's algorithm (SA) is a quantum algorithm for factoring integers. Since SA has polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are sub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in the quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial scaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We also show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of suppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator precision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA. Additionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit for the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence on every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect of operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum computers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than classical computers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3076v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"SA-IGA: A Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Method Towards Socially
  Optimal Outcomes"	Chengwei Zhang	Xiaohong Li, Jianye Hao, Siqi Chen, Karl Tuyls, Wanli Xue	2018-03-08 10:02:42	In multiagent environments, the capability of learning is important for an agent to behave appropriately in face of unknown opponents and dynamic environment. From the system designer's perspective, it is desirable if the agents can learn to coordinate towards socially optimal outcomes, while also avoiding being exploited by selfish opponents. To this end, we propose a novel gradient ascent based algorithm (SA-IGA) which augments the basic gradient-ascent algorithm by incorporating social awareness into the policy update process. We theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of SA-IGA using dynamical system theory and SA-IGA is shown to have linear dynamics for a wide range of games including symmetric games. The learning dynamics of two representative games (the prisoner's dilemma game and the coordination game) are analyzed in details. Based on the idea of SA-IGA, we further propose a practical multiagent learning algorithm, called SA-PGA, based on Q-learning update rule. Simulation results show that SA-PGA agent can achieve higher social welfare than previous social-optimality oriented Conditional Joint Action Learner (CJAL) and also is robust against individually rational opponents by reaching Nash equilibrium solutions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03021v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A plug-and-play type field-deployable bio-agent free salicylic acid
  sensing system"	Bhuwan Kashyap	Ratnesh Kumar	2021-05-04 03:44:30	Salicylic acid (SA) is a primary phytohormone released in response to stress, particularly biotic infections in plants. Monitoring SA levels may provide a way for early disease detection in crops providing a way for applying effective measures for reducing agricultural losses while increase our agricultural efficiency. Additionally, SA is an important chemical used extensively in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Developing a fast and accurate way for monitoring SA levels in human serum can have a life-saving impact for patients suffering from overdosing and/or mis-dosing. In this work, we present a low-cost, portable, and field-deployable electrochemical SA sensing system aimed towards achieving the above-mentioned goals. The developed sensor consists of a plug-and-play type device equipped with specialized designed high accuracy sensing electronics and a novel procedure for robust data analysis. The developed sensor exhibits excellent linearity and sensitivity and selectivity. The practical applicability of the developed sensor was also demonstrated by measuring SA levels in real samples with good accuracy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04417v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Growth in Sumsets of Higher Convex Functions	Peter J. Bradshaw	Aucun	2021-11-05 16:14:44	The main results of this paper concern growth in sums of a $k$-convex function $f$. Firstly, we streamline the proof of a growth result for $f(A)$ where $A$ has small additive doubling, and improve the bound by removing logarithmic factors. The result yields an optimal bound for \[ |2^k f(A) - (2^k-1)f(A)|. \]   We also generalise a recent result of Hanson, Roche-Newton and Senger, by proving that for any finite $A\subset \mathbb{R}$   \[ | 2^k f(sA-sA) - (2^k-1) f(sA-sA)| \gg_s |A|^{2s} \] where $s = \frac{k+1}{2}$. This allows us to prove that, given any natural number $s \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $m = m(s)$ such that if $A \subset \mathbb{R}$, then \begin{equation}\label{conj A-Aus} |(sA-sA)^{(m)}| \gg_s |A|^{s}. \end{equation}   This is progress towards a conjecture which states that the above inequality can be replaced with   \[|(A-A)^{(m)}| \gg_s |A|^{s}.\]   Developing methods of Solymosi, and Bloom and Jones, we present some new sum-product type results in the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ and in the function field $\mathbb{F}_q((t^{-1}))$.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03586v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Neural Simulated Annealing	Alvaro H. C. Correia	Daniel E. Worrall, Roberto Bondesan	2022-03-04 09:19:28	Simulated annealing (SA) is a stochastic global optimisation technique applicable to a wide range of discrete and continuous variable problems. Despite its simplicity, the development of an effective SA optimiser for a given problem hinges on a handful of carefully handpicked components; namely, neighbour proposal distribution and temperature annealing schedule. In this work, we view SA from a reinforcement learning perspective and frame the proposal distribution as a policy, which can be optimised for higher solution quality given a fixed computational budget. We demonstrate that this Neural SA with such a learnt proposal distribution, parametrised by small equivariant neural networks, outperforms SA baselines on a number of problems: Rosenbrock's function, the Knapsack problem, the Bin Packing problem, and the Travelling Salesperson problem. We also show that Neural SA scales well to large problems - generalising to significantly larger problems than the ones seen during training - while achieving comparable performance to popular off-the-shelf solvers and other machine learning methods in terms of solution quality and wall-clock time.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02201v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Design of a stiffness adjustable magnetic fluid shock absorber based on
  optimal stiffness coefficient"	Yanwen Li	Decai Li, Yingsong Li	2022-09-18 15:56:10	With the rapid development of aerospace technology, the vibration problem of the spacecraft flexible structure urgently needs to be solved. Magnetic fluids are a type of multi-functional smart materials, which can be employed in shock absorbers to eliminate these vibrations. Referring to the calculation methods of stiffness coefficients of other passive dampers, the stiffness coefficient formula of magnetic fluid shock absorbers (MFSAs) was derived. Meanwhile, a novel stiffness adjustable magnetic fluid shock absorber (SA-MFSA) was proposed. On the basis of the second-order buoyancy principle, a series of SA-MFSAs were fabricated. The range of stiffness coefficients covered by these SA-MFSAs contains the optimal stiffness coefficient estimated by formulas. The repulsive force measurement and vibration attenuation experiments were conducted on these SA-MFSAs. In the case of small amplitude, the relationship between the repulsive force and the offset distance was linear. The simulation and experiment curves of repulsive forces were in good agreement. The results of vibration attenuation experiments demonstrated that the rod length and the magnetic fluid mass influence the damping efficiency of SA-MFSAs. In addition, these results verified that the SA-MFSA with the optimal stiffness coefficient performed best. Therefore, the stiffness coefficient formula can guide the design of MFSAs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08588v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Spectral Aware Softmax for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification	Lei Tan	Pingyang Dai, Qixiang Ye, Mingliang Xu, Yongjian Wu, Rongrong Ji	2023-02-03 02:57:18	Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match specific pedestrian images from different modalities. Although suffering an extra modality discrepancy, existing methods still follow the softmax loss training paradigm, which is widely used in single-modality classification tasks. The softmax loss lacks an explicit penalty for the apparent modality gap, which adversely limits the performance upper bound of the VI-ReID task. In this paper, we propose the spectral-aware softmax (SA-Softmax) loss, which can fully explore the embedding space with the modality information and has clear interpretability. Specifically, SA-Softmax loss utilizes an asynchronous optimization strategy based on the modality prototype instead of the synchronous optimization based on the identity prototype in the original softmax loss. To encourage a high overlapping between two modalities, SA-Softmax optimizes each sample by the prototype from another spectrum. Based on the observation and analysis of SA-Softmax, we modify the SA-Softmax with the Feature Mask and Absolute-Similarity Term to alleviate the ambiguous optimization during model training. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on RegDB and SYSU-MM01 demonstrate the superior performance of the SA-Softmax over the state-of-the-art methods in such a cross-modality condition.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01512v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Improving Transformer-based End-to-End Speaker Diarization by Assigning
  Auxiliary Losses to Attention Heads"	Ye-Rin Jeoung	Joon-Young Yang, Jeong-Hwan Choi, Joon-Hyuk Chang	2023-03-02 12:15:36	Transformer-based end-to-end neural speaker diarization (EEND) models utilize the multi-head self-attention (SA) mechanism to enable accurate speaker label prediction in overlapped speech regions. In this study, to enhance the training effectiveness of SA-EEND models, we propose the use of auxiliary losses for the SA heads of the transformer layers. Specifically, we assume that the attention weight matrices of an SA layer are redundant if their patterns are similar to those of the identity matrix. We then explicitly constrain such matrices to exhibit specific speaker activity patterns relevant to voice activity detection or overlapped speech detection tasks. Consequently, we expect the proposed auxiliary losses to guide the transformer layers to exhibit more diverse patterns in the attention weights, thereby reducing the assumed redundancies in the SA heads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the simulated and CALLHOME datasets for two-speaker diarization tasks, reducing the diarization error rate of the conventional SA-EEND model by 32.58% and 17.11%, respectively.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01192v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Advances in Self-Supervised Learning for Synthetic Aperture Sonar Data
  Processing, Classification, and Pattern Recognition"	Brandon Sheffield	Frank E. Bobe III, Bradley Marchand, Matthew S. Emigh	2023-08-12 20:59:39	Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) imaging has become a crucial technology for underwater exploration because of its unique ability to maintain resolution at increasing ranges, a characteristic absent in conventional sonar techniques. However, the effective application of deep learning to SAS data processing is often limited due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes MoCo-SAS that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) for SAS data processing, classification, and pattern recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that MoCo-SAS significantly outperforms traditional supervised learning methods, as evidenced by significant improvements observed in terms of the F1-score. These findings highlight the potential of SSL in advancing the state-of-the-art in SAS data processing, offering promising avenues for enhanced underwater object detection and classification.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11633v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Intrinsic Alignment in redMaPPer clusters -- II. Radial alignment of
  satellites toward cluster centers"	Hung-Jin Huang	Rachel Mandelbaum, Peter E. Freeman, Yen-Chi Chen, Eduardo Rozo, Eli Rykoff	2017-04-20 18:00:06	We study the orientations of satellite galaxies in redMaPPer clusters constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $0.1<z<0.35$ to determine whether there is any preferential tendency for satellites to point radially toward cluster centers. We analyze the satellite alignment (SA) signal based on three shape measurement methods (re-Gaussianization, de Vaucouleurs, and isophotal shapes), which trace galaxy light profiles at different radii. The measured SA signal depends on these shape measurement methods. We detect the strongest SA signal in isophotal shapes, followed by de Vaucouleurs shapes. While no net SA signal is detected using re-Gaussianization shapes across the entire sample, the observed SA signal reaches a statistically significant level when limiting to a subsample of higher luminosity satellites. We further investigate the impact of noise, systematics, and real physical isophotal twisting effects in the comparison between the SA signal detected via different shape measurement methods. Unlike previous studies, which only consider the dependence of SA on a few parameters, here we explore a total of 17 galaxy and cluster properties, using a statistical model averaging technique to naturally account for parameter correlations and identify significant SA predictors. We find that the measured SA signal is strongest for satellites with the following characteristics: higher luminosity, smaller distance to the cluster center, rounder in shape, higher bulge fraction, and distributed preferentially along the major axis directions of their centrals. Finally, we provide physical explanations for the identified dependences, and discuss the connection to theories of SA.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2995	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Reflections on Surrogate-Assisted Search-Based Testing: A Taxonomy and
  Two Replication Studies based on Industrial ADAS and Simulink Models"	Shiva Nejati	Lev Sorokin, Damir Safin, Federico Formica, Mohammad Mahdi Mahboob, Claudio Menghi	2023-04-28 20:34:30	Surrogate-assisted search-based testing (SA-SBT) aims to reduce the computational time for testing compute-intensive systems. Surrogates enhance testing techniques by improving test case generation focusing the testing budget on the most critical portions of the input domain. In addition, they can serve as approximations of the system under test (SUT) to predict tests' results instead of executing the tests on compute-intensive SUTs. This article reflects on the existing SA-SBT techniques, particularly those applied to system-level testing and often facilitated using simulators or complex test beds. Our objective is to synthesize different heuristic algorithms and evaluation methods employed in existing SA-SBT techniques and present a comprehensive view of SA-SBT solutions. In addition, by critically reviewing our previous work on SA-SBT, we aim to identify the limitations in our proposed algorithms and evaluation methods and to propose potential improvements. We present a taxonomy that categorizes and contrasts existing SA-SBT solutions and highlights key research gaps. To identify the evaluation challenges, we conduct two replication studies of our past SA-SBT solutions: One study uses industrial advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and the other relies on a Simulink model benchmark. We compare our results with those of the original studies and identify the difficulties in evaluating SA-SBT techniques, including the impact of different contextual factors on results generalization and the validity of our evaluation metrics. Based on our taxonomy and replication studies, we propose future research directions, including re-considerations in the current evaluation metrics used for SA-SBT solutions, utilizing surrogates for fault localization and repair in addition to testing, and creating frameworks for large-scale experiments by applying SA-SBT to multiple SUTs and simulators.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00083v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Performance of a GPU-based Direct Summation Algorithm for Computation of
  Small Angle Scattering Profile"	Konstantin Berlin	Nail A. Gumerov, Ramani Duraiswami, David Fushman	2013-06-10 17:44:17	Small Angle Scattering (SAS) of X-rays or neutrons is an experimental technique that provides valuable structural information for biological macromolecules under physiological conditions and with no limitation on the molecular size. In order to refine molecular structure against experimental SAS data, ab initio prediction of the scattering profile must be recomputed hundreds of thousands of times, which involves the computation of the sinc kernel over all pairs of atoms in a molecule. The quadratic computational complexity of predicting the SAS profile limits the size of the molecules and and has been a major impediment for integration of SAS data into structure refinement protocols. In order to significantly speed up prediction of the SAS profile we present a general purpose graphical processing unit (GPU) algorithm, written in OpenCL, for the summation of the sinc kernel (Debye summation) over all pairs of atoms. This program is an order of magnitude faster than a parallel CPU algorithm, and faster than an FMM-like approximation method for certain input domains. We show that our algorithm is currently the fastest method for performing SAS computation for small and medium size molecules (around 50000 atoms or less). This algorithm is critical for quick and accurate SAS profile computation of elongated structures, such as DNA, RNA, and sparsely spaced pseudo-atom molecules.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2258v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"State-averaged Monte Carlo configuration interaction applied to
  electronically excited states"	J. P. Coe	M. J. Paterson	2014-02-28 15:32:46	We introduce state-averaging into the method of Monte Carlo configuration interaction (SA-MCCI) to allow the stable and efficient calculation of excited states. We show that excited potential curves for H$_{3}$, including a crossing with the ground state, can be accurately reproduced using a small fraction of the FCI space. A recently introduced error measure for potential curves [J. P. Coe and M. J. Paterson, J. Chem. Phys., 137, 204108 (2012)] is shown to also be a fair approach when considering potential curves for multiple states. We demonstrate that potential curves for LiF using SA-MCCI agree well with the FCI results and the avoided crossing occurs correctly. The seam of conical intersections for CH$_{2}$ found by Yarkony [J. Chem. Phys., 104, 2932 (1996)] is used as a test for SA-MCCI and we compare potential curves from SA-MCCI with FCI results for this system for the first three triplet states. We then demonstrate the improvement from using SA-MCCI on the dipole of the $2$ $^{1}A_{1}$ state of carbon monoxide. We then look at vertical excitations for small organic molecules up to the size of butadiene where the SA-MCCI energies and oscillator strengths are compared with CASPT2 values [M. Schreiber, M. R. Silva-Junior, S. P. A. Sauer, and W. Thiel, J. Chem. Phys., 128, 134110 (2008)]. We finally see if the SA-MCCI results for these excitation energies can be improved by using MCCIPT2 with approximate natural orbitals when the PT2 space is not onerously large.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4824888	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Kinetic and Cyber	Alexander Kott	Norbou Buchler, Kristin E. Schaefer	2015-11-11 15:25:46	We compare and contrast situation awareness in cyber warfare and in conventional, kinetic warfare. Situation awareness (SA) has a far longer history of study and applications in such areas as control of complex enterprises and in conventional warfare, than in cyber warfare. Far more is known about the SA in conventional military conflicts, or adversarial engagements, than in cyber ones. By exploring what is known about SA in conventional, also commonly referred to as kinetic, battles, we may gain insights and research directions relevant to cyber conflicts. We discuss the nature of SA in conventional (often called kinetic) conflict, review what is known about this kinetic SA (KSA), and then offer a comparison with what is currently understood regarding the cyber SA (CSA). We find that challenges and opportunities of KSA and CSA are similar or at least parallel in several important ways. With respect to similarities, in both kinetic and cyber worlds, SA strongly impacts the outcome of the mission. Also similarly, cognitive biases are found in both KSA and CSA. As an example of differences, KSA often relies on commonly accepted, widely used organizing representation - map of the physical terrain of the battlefield. No such common representation has emerged in CSA, yet.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03531v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Normalized and Geometry-Aware Self-Attention Network for Image
  Captioning"	Longteng Guo	Jing Liu, Xinxin Zhu, Peng Yao, Shichen Lu, Hanqing Lu	2020-03-19 16:54:16	Self-attention (SA) network has shown profound value in image captioning. In this paper, we improve SA from two aspects to promote the performance of image captioning. First, we propose Normalized Self-Attention (NSA), a reparameterization of SA that brings the benefits of normalization inside SA. While normalization is previously only applied outside SA, we introduce a novel normalization method and demonstrate that it is both possible and beneficial to perform it on the hidden activations inside SA. Second, to compensate for the major limit of Transformer that it fails to model the geometry structure of the input objects, we propose a class of Geometry-aware Self-Attention (GSA) that extends SA to explicitly and efficiently consider the relative geometry relations between the objects in the image. To construct our image captioning model, we combine the two modules and apply it to the vanilla self-attention network. We extensively evaluate our proposals on MS-COCO image captioning dataset and superior results are achieved when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. Further experiments on three challenging tasks, i.e. video captioning, machine translation, and visual question answering, show the generality of our methods.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08897v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Super learning in the SAS system	Alexander P. Keil	Daniel Westreich, Jessie K Edwards, Stephen R Cole	2018-05-21 13:53:08	Background and objective: Stacking is an ensemble machine learning method that averages predictions from multiple other algorithms, such as generalized linear models and regression trees. An implementation of stacking, called super learning, has been developed as a general approach to supervised learning and has seen frequent usage, in part due to the availability of an R package. We develop super learning in the SAS software system using a new macro, and demonstrate its performance relative to the R package.   Methods: Following previous work using the R SuperLearner package we assess the performance of super learning in a number of domains. We compare the R package with the new SAS macro in a small set of simulations assessing curve fitting in a predictive model as well in a set of 14 publicly available datasets to assess cross-validated accuracy.   Results: Across the simulated data and the publicly available data, the SAS macro performed similarly to the R package, despite a different set of potential algorithms available natively in R and SAS.   Conclusions: Our super learner macro performs as well as the R package at a number of tasks. Further, by extending the macro to include the use of R packages, the macro can leverage both the robust, enterprise oriented procedures in SAS and the nimble, cutting edge packages in R. In the spirit of ensemble learning, this macro extends the potential library of algorithms beyond a single software system and provides a simple avenue into machine learning in SAS.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08058v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Application of Stochastic and Deterministic Techniques for Uncertainty
  Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis of Energy Systems"	Majdi I. Radaideh	Mohammad I. Radaideh	2019-01-17 00:00:27	Sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) are used to assess and improve engineering models. In this study, various methods of SA and UQ are described and applied in theoretical and practical examples for use in energy system analysis. This paper includes local SA (one-at-a-time linear perturbation), global SA (Morris screening), variance decomposition (Sobol indices), and regression-based SA. For UQ, stochastic methods (Monte Carlo sampling) and deterministic methods (using SA profiles) are used. Simple test problems are included to demonstrate the described methods where input parameter interactions, linear correlation, model nonlinearity, local sensitivity, output uncertainty, and variance contribution are explored. Practical applications of analyzing the efficiency and power output uncertainty of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) are conducted. Using different methods, the uncertainty in the MCFC responses is about 10%. Both SA and UQ methods agree on the importance ranking of the fuel cell operating temperature and cathode activation energy as the most influential parameters. Both parameters contribute to more than 90% of the maximum power and efficiency variance. The methods applied in this paper can be used to achieve a comprehensive mathematical understanding of a particular energy model, which can lead to better performance.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/er.4837	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Sensitivity analysis of a galaxy formation model	Piotr Oleskiewicz	Carlton M. Baugh	2019-10-03 22:10:06	"We present the first application of a variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA) to a model that aims to predict the evolution and properties of the whole galaxy population. SA is a well-established technique in other quantitative sciences, but is a relatively novel tool for the evaluation of astrophysical models. We perform a multi-parameter exploration of the GALFORM semi-analytic galaxy formation model, to compute how sensitive the present-day K-band luminosity function is to varying different model parameters. The parameter space is scanned using a low-discrepancy sampling technique proposed by Saltelli. We first demonstrate the usefulness of the SA approach by varying just two model parameters, one which controls supernova feedback and the other the heating of gas by AGN. The SA analysis matches our physical intuition regarding how these parameters affect the predictions for different parts of the galaxy luminosity function. We then use SA to compute Sobol' sensitivity indices varying seven model parameters, connecting the variance in the model output to the variance in the input parameters. The sensitivity is computed in luminosity bins, allowing us to probe the origin of the model predictions in detail. We discover that the SA correctly identifies the least- and most important parameters. Moreover, the SA also captures the combined responses of varying multiple parameters at the same time. Our study marks a much needed step away from the traditional ""one-at-a-time"" parameter variation often used in this area and improves the transparency of multi-parameter models of galaxy formation."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3560	cs	arxiv					0.0	
SA-Net: Shuffle Attention for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	Qing-Long Zhang Yu-Bin Yang	Aucun	2021-01-30 15:23:17	"Attention mechanisms, which enable a neural network to accurately focus on all the relevant elements of the input, have become an essential component to improve the performance of deep neural networks. There are mainly two attention mechanisms widely used in computer vision studies, \textit{spatial attention} and \textit{channel attention}, which aim to capture the pixel-level pairwise relationship and channel dependency, respectively. Although fusing them together may achieve better performance than their individual implementations, it will inevitably increase the computational overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient Shuffle Attention (SA) module to address this issue, which adopts Shuffle Units to combine two types of attention mechanisms effectively. Specifically, SA first groups channel dimensions into multiple sub-features before processing them in parallel. Then, for each sub-feature, SA utilizes a Shuffle Unit to depict feature dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions. After that, all sub-features are aggregated and a ""channel shuffle"" operator is adopted to enable information communication between different sub-features. The proposed SA module is efficient yet effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of SA against the backbone ResNet50 are 300 vs. 25.56M and 2.76e-3 GFLOPs vs. 4.12 GFLOPs, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 1.34% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. Extensive experimental results on common-used benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for classification, MS COCO for object detection, and instance segmentation, demonstrate that the proposed SA outperforms the current SOTA methods significantly by achieving higher accuracy while having lower model complexity. The code and models are available at https://github.com/wofmanaf/SA-Net."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00240v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Rudas, Ljiljana Trajkovic, Okyay Kaynak, Janusz Kacprzyk, Mengchu Zhou, Michael H. Smith, Philip Chen, Shushma Patel	2021-02-11 05:44:25	Symbiotic Autonomous Systems (SAS) are advanced intelligent and cognitive systems exhibiting autonomous collective intelligence enabled by coherent symbiosis of human-machine interactions in hybrid societies. Basic research in the emerging field of SAS has triggered advanced general AI technologies functioning without human intervention or hybrid symbiotic systems synergizing humans and intelligent machines into coherent cognitive systems. This work presents a theoretical framework of SAS underpinned by the latest advances in intelligence, cognition, computer, and system sciences. SAS are characterized by the composition of autonomous and symbiotic systems that adopt bio-brain-social-inspired and heterogeneously synergized structures and autonomous behaviors. This paper explores their cognitive and mathematical foundations. The challenge to seamless human-machine interactions in a hybrid environment is addressed. SAS-based collective intelligence is explored in order to augment human capability by autonomous machine intelligence towards the next generation of general AI, autonomous computers, and trustworthy mission-critical intelligent systems. Emerging paradigms and engineering applications of SAS are elaborated via an autonomous knowledge learning system that symbiotically works between humans and cognitive robots.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0362	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Comparative Study of Modular and Joint Approaches for
  Speaker-Attributed ASR on Monaural Long-Form Audio"	Naoyuki Kanda	Xiong Xiao, Jian Wu, Tianyan Zhou, Yashesh Gaur, Xiaofei Wang, Zhong Meng, Zhuo Chen, Takuya Yoshioka	2021-07-06 19:36:48	"Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) is a task to recognize ""who spoke what"" from multi-talker recordings. An SA-ASR system usually consists of multiple modules such as speech separation, speaker diarization and ASR. On the other hand, considering the joint optimization, an end-to-end (E2E) SA-ASR model has recently been proposed with promising results on simulation data. In this paper, we present our recent study on the comparison of such modular and joint approaches towards SA-ASR on real monaural recordings. We develop state-of-the-art SA-ASR systems for both modular and joint approaches by leveraging large-scale training data, including 75 thousand hours of ASR training data and the VoxCeleb corpus for speaker representation learning. We also propose a new pipeline that performs the E2E SA-ASR model after speaker clustering. Our evaluation on the AMI meeting corpus reveals that after fine-tuning with a small real data, the joint system performs 8.9--29.9% better in accuracy compared to the best modular system while the modular system performs better before such fine-tuning. We also conduct various error analyses to show the remaining issues for the monaural SA-ASR."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02852v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"State-Aware Proximal Pessimistic Algorithms for Offline Reinforcement
  Learning"	Chen Chen	Hongyao Tang, Yi Ma, Chao Wang, Qianli Shen, Dong Li, Jianye Hao	2022-11-28 04:56:40	Pessimism is of great importance in offline reinforcement learning (RL). One broad category of offline RL algorithms fulfills pessimism by explicit or implicit behavior regularization. However, most of them only consider policy divergence as behavior regularization, ignoring the effect of how the offline state distribution differs with that of the learning policy, which may lead to under-pessimism for some states and over-pessimism for others. Taking account of this problem, we propose a principled algorithmic framework for offline RL, called \emph{State-Aware Proximal Pessimism} (SA-PP). The key idea of SA-PP is leveraging discounted stationary state distribution ratios between the learning policy and the offline dataset to modulate the degree of behavior regularization in a state-wise manner, so that pessimism can be implemented in a more appropriate way. We first provide theoretical justifications on the superiority of SA-PP over previous algorithms, demonstrating that SA-PP produces a lower suboptimality upper bound in a broad range of settings. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm named \emph{State-Aware Conservative Q-Learning} (SA-CQL), by building SA-PP upon representative CQL algorithm with the help of DualDICE for estimating discounted stationary state distribution ratios. Extensive experiments on standard offline RL benchmark show that SA-CQL outperforms the popular baselines on a large portion of benchmarks and attains the highest average return.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15065v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"CNN-Assisted Steganography -- Integrating Machine Learning with
  Established Steganographic Techniques"	Andrew Havard	Theodore Manikas, Eric C. Larson, Mitchell A. Thornton	2023-04-25 00:19:23	We propose a method to improve steganography by increasing the resilience of stego-media to discovery through steganalysis. Our approach enhances a class of steganographic approaches through the inclusion of a steganographic assistant convolutional neural network (SA-CNN). Previous research showed success in discovering the presence of hidden information within stego-images using trained neural networks as steganalyzers that are applied to stego-images. Our results show that such steganalyzers are less effective when SA-CNN is employed during the generation of a stego-image. We also explore the advantages and disadvantages of representing all the possible outputs of our SA-CNN within a smaller, discrete space, rather than a continuous space. Our SA-CNN enables certain classes of parametric steganographic algorithms to be customized based on characteristics of the cover media in which information is to be embedded. Thus, SA-CNN is adaptive in the sense that it enables the core steganographic algorithm to be especially configured for each particular instance of cover media. Experimental results are provided that employ a recent steganographic technique, S-UNIWARD, both with and without the use of SA-CNN. We then apply both sets of stego-images, those produced with and without SA-CNN, to an exmaple steganalyzer, Yedroudj-Net, and we compare the results. We believe that this approach for the integration of neural networks with hand-crafted algorithms increases the reliability and adaptability of steganographic algorithms.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12503v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Sudden Drops in the Loss: Syntax Acquisition, Phase Transitions, and
  Simplicity Bias in MLMs"	Angelica Chen	Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Kyunghyun Cho, Matthew L. Leavitt, Naomi Saphra	2023-09-13 20:57:11	Most interpretability research in NLP focuses on understanding the behavior and features of a fully trained model. However, certain insights into model behavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training process. We present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked language models (MLMs) that demonstrates how analyzing the evolution of interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in pretraining when models abruptly acquire SAS, concurrent with a steep drop in loss. This breakthrough precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by manipulating SAS during training, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS improves model quality. These findings offer an interpretation of a real-world example of both simplicity bias and breakthrough training dynamics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07311v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Robust and Attack Resilient Logic Locking with a High Application-Level
  Impact"	Yuntao Liu	Michael Zuzak, Yang Xie, Abhishek Chakraborty, Ankur Srivastava	2021-01-07 15:01:31	"Logic locking is a hardware security technique to intellectual property (IP) against security threats in the IC supply chain, especially untrusted fabs. Such techniques incorporate additional locking circuitry within an IC that induces incorrect functionality when an incorrect key is provided. The amount of error induced is known as the effectiveness of the locking technique. ""SAT attacks"" provide a strong mathematical formulation to find the correct key of locked circuits. In order to achieve high SAT resilience(i.e. complexity of SAT attacks), many conventional logic locking schemes fail to inject sufficient error into the circuit. For example, in the case of SARLock and Anti-SAT, there are usually very few (or only one) input minterms that cause any error at the circuit output. The state-of-the-art stripped functionality logic locking (SFLL) technique introduced a trade-off between SAT resilience and effectiveness. In this work, we prove that such a trade-off is universal in logic locking. In order to attain high effectiveness of locking without compromising SAT resilience, we propose a novel logic locking scheme, called Strong Anti-SAT (SAS). In addition to SAT attacks, removal-based attacks are also popular against logic locking. Based on SAS, we propose Robust SAS (RSAS) which is resilient to removal attacks and maintains the same SAT resilience and as effectiveness as SAS. SAS and RSAS have the following significant improvements over existing techniques. (1) SAT resilience of SAS and RSAS against SAT attack is not compromised by increase in effectiveness. (2) In contrast to prior work focusing solely on the circuit-level locking impact, we integrate SAS-locked modules into a processor and show that SAS has a high application-level impact. (3) Our experiments show that SAS and RSAS exhibit better SAT resilience than SFLL and have similar effectiveness."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02577v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Titanium:Sapphire-on-insulator for broadband tunable lasers and
  high-power amplifiers on chip"	Joshua Yang	Kasper Van Gasse, Daniil M. Lukin, Melissa A. Guidry, Geun Ho Ahn, Alexander D. White, Jelena Vučković	2023-12-01 00:07:38	Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers have been essential for advancing fundamental research and technological applications. Ti:Sa lasers are unmatched in bandwidth and tuning range, yet their use is severely restricted due to their large size, cost, and need for high optical pump powers. Here, we demonstrate a monocrystalline Ti:Sa-on-insulator (Ti:SaOI) photonics platform which enables dramatic miniaturization, cost-reduction, and scalability of Ti:Sa technology. First, through fabrication of low-loss whispering gallery mode resonators, we realize a Ti:Sa laser operating with an ultra-low lasing threshold of 290 $\mu$W. Then, through orders-of-magnitude improvement in mode confinement in Ti:SaOI waveguides, we realize the first integrated solid-state (i.e., non-semiconductor) optical amplifier operating below 1 $\mu$m, with an ultra-wide bandwidth of 700 - 950 nm and peak gain of 64 dB/cm. We demonstrate unprecedented 17 dB distortion-free amplification of picosecond pulses to up to 2.3 nJ pulse energy, corresponding to a peak power of 1.0 kW. Finally, we demonstrate the first tunable integrated Ti:Sa laser, featuring narrow linewidths and a 24.7 THz tuning range, which, for the first time, can be pumped with low-cost, miniature, off-the-shelf green laser diodes. This opens doors to new modalities of Ti:Sa lasers (now occupying a footprint less than 0.15 mm$^2$), such as massively-scalable Ti:Sa laser array systems for a variety of applications. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we employ a Ti:SaOI laser array as the sole optical control for a cavity quantum electrodynamics experiment with artificial atoms in silicon carbide. This work is a key step towards the democratization of Ti:Sa technology through a three orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and footprint, as well as the introduction of solid-state broadband amplification of sub-micron wavelength light.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00256v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Hypergraph Automata: A Theoretical Model for Patterned Self-assembly	Lila Kari	Steffen Kopecki, Amirhossein Simjour	2013-02-12 16:14:27	Patterned self-assembly is a process whereby coloured tiles self-assemble to build a rectangular coloured pattern. We propose self-assembly (SA) hypergraph automata as an automata-theoretic model for patterned self-assembly. We investigate the computational power of SA-hypergraph automata and show that for every recognizable picture language, there exists an SA-hypergraph automaton that accepts this language. Conversely, we prove that for any restricted SA-hypergraph automaton, there exists a Wang Tile System, a model for recognizable picture languages, that accepts the same language. The advantage of SA-hypergraph automata over Wang automata, acceptors for the class of recognizable picture languages, is that they do not rely on an a priori defined scanning strategy	http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2840v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Effects of the rotating wave and secular approximations on
  non-Markovianity"	H. Mäkelä	M. Möttönen	2013-06-26 17:56:43	We study the effect of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and the secular approximation (SA) on the non-Markovian behavior in the spin-boson model at zero-temperature. We find that both the RWA and SA lead to a dramatic reduction in the observed non-Markovianity. In general, non-Markovian dynamics is observed for the whole relaxation time of the system, whereas the RWA and SA lead to such dynamics only on the short time scale of the environmental correlation time. Thus, the RWA and SA are not necessarily justified in the studies of non-Markovianity although they can estimate the state of the system precisely. Furthermore, we derive an accurate analytical expression for the non-Markovianity measure without the RWA or SA. This expression yields important insight into the physics of the problem.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.88.052111	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Simulated annealing: in mathematical global optimization computation,
  hybrid with local or global search, and practical applications in
  crystallography and molecular modelling"	Jiapu Zhang	Aucun	2013-08-28 17:06:35	Simulated annealing (SA) was inspired from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size of its crystals and reduce their defects, both are attributes of the material that depend on its thermodynamic free energy. In this Paper, firstly we will study SA in details on its practical implementation. Then, hybrid pure SA with local (or global) search optimization methods allows us to be able to design several effective and efficient global search optimization methods. In order to keep the original sense of SA, we clarify our understandings of SA in crystallography and molecular modeling field through the studies of prion amyloid fibrils.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6220v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
An improved Ant Colony System for the Sequential Ordering Problem	Rafał Skinderowicz	Aucun	2017-05-02 17:17:26	It is not rare that the performance of one metaheuristic algorithm can be improved by incorporating ideas taken from another. In this article we present how Simulated Annealing (SA) can be used to improve the efficiency of the Ant Colony System (ACS) and Enhanced ACS when solving the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP). Moreover, we show how the very same ideas can be applied to improve the convergence of a dedicated local search, i.e. the SOP-3-exchange algorithm. A statistical analysis of the proposed algorithms both in terms of finding suitable parameter values and the quality of the generated solutions is presented based on a series of computational experiments conducted on SOP instances from the well-known TSPLIB and SOPLIB2006 repositories. The proposed ACS-SA and EACS-SA algorithms often generate solutions of better quality than the ACS and EACS, respectively. Moreover, the EACS-SA algorithm combined with the proposed SOP-3-exchange-SA local search was able to find 10 new best solutions for the SOP instances from the SOPLIB2006 repository, thus improving the state-of-the-art results as known from the literature. Overall, the best known or improved solutions were found in 41 out of 48 cases.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2017.04.012	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Language Transfer of Audio Word2Vec: Learning Audio Segment
  Representations without Target Language Data"	Chia-Hao Shen	Janet Y. Sung, Hung-Yi Lee	2017-07-19 10:54:00	Audio Word2Vec offers vector representations of fixed dimensionality for variable-length audio segments using Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA). These vector representations are shown to describe the sequential phonetic structures of the audio segments to a good degree, with real world applications such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection (STD). This paper examines the capability of language transfer of Audio Word2Vec. We train SA from one language (source language) and use it to extract the vector representation of the audio segments of another language (target language). We found that SA can still catch phonetic structure from the audio segments of the target language if the source and target languages are similar. In query-by-example STD, we obtain the vector representations from the SA learned from a large amount of source language data, and found them surpass the representations from naive encoder and SA directly learned from a small amount of target language data. The result shows that it is possible to learn Audio Word2Vec model from high-resource languages and use it on low-resource languages. This further expands the usability of Audio Word2Vec.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06519v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Multiband SAS Imagery	Isaac D Gerg	Aucun	2018-08-08 14:19:38	Advances in unmanned synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imaging platforms allow for the simultaneous collection of multiband SAS imagery. The imagery is collected over several octaves and the phenomenology's interactions with the sea floor vary greatly over this range -- higher frequencies resolve proud and fine structure of the seafloor while lower frequencies resolve subsurface features and often induce internal resonance in man-made objects. Currently, analysts examine multiband imagery by viewing a single band at a time. This method makes it difficult to ascertain correlations between any pair of bands collected over the same location. To mitigate this issue, we propose methods which ingest high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) SAS imagery and generates a color composite creating what we call a multiband SAS (MSAS) image. The MSAS image contains the relevant portions of the HF and LF images required by an analyst to interpret the scene and are defined using a spatial saliency metric computed for each image. We then combine the saliency and acoustic backscatter measures to form the final MSAS image.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02792v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Concurrent Segmentation and Object Detection CNNs for Aircraft Detection
  and Identification in Satellite Images"	Damien Grosgeorge	Maxime Arbelot, Alex Goupilleau, Tugdual Ceillier, Renaud Allioux	2020-05-27 07:35:55	Detecting and identifying objects in satellite images is a very challenging task: objects of interest are often very small and features can be difficult to recognize even using very high resolution imagery. For most applications, this translates into a trade-off between recall and precision. We present here a dedicated method to detect and identify aircraft, combining two very different convolutional neural networks (CNNs): a segmentation model, based on a modified U-net architecture, and a detection model, based on the RetinaNet architecture. The results we present show that this combination outperforms significantly each unitary model, reducing drastically the false negative rate.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13215v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Lifelong Testing of Smart Autonomous Systems by Shepherding a Swarm of
  Watchdog Artificial Intelligence Agents"	Hussein Abbass	John Harvey, Kate Yaxley	2018-12-21 05:53:47	Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could be broadly categorised into Analytics and Autonomy. Analytics focuses on algorithms offering perception, comprehension, and projection of knowledge gleaned from sensorial data. Autonomy revolves around decision making, and influencing and shaping the environment through action production. A smart autonomous system (SAS) combines analytics and autonomy to understand, learn, decide and act autonomously. To be useful, SAS must be trusted and that requires testing. Lifelong learning of a SAS compounds the testing process. In the remote chance that it is possible to fully test and certify the system pre-release, which is theoretically an undecidable problem, it is near impossible to predict the future behaviours that these systems, alone or collectively, will exhibit. While it may be feasible to severely restrict such systems\textquoteright \ learning abilities to limit the potential unpredictability of their behaviours, an undesirable consequence may be severely limiting their utility. In this paper, we propose the architecture for a watchdog AI (WAI) agent dedicated to lifelong functional testing of SAS. We further propose system specifications including a level of abstraction whereby humans shepherd a swarm of WAI agents to oversee an ecosystem made of humans and SAS. The discussion extends to the challenges, pros, and cons of the proposed concept.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08960v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Application of the ASBM-SA closure in a turbulent flow over a hump in
  the presence of separation control"	Constantinos F. Panagiotou	Fotos S. Stylianou, Elias Gravanis, Evangelos Akylas, Stavros C. Kassinos	2020-03-01 20:44:31	We demonstrate the coupling between the Algebraic Structure-Based Model (ASBM) and the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model, which provides an easy route to bringing structure information in engineering turbulence closures. The estimation ability of the hybrid model was tested for a flow over a hump model with no-flow control and steady suction. ASBM-SA model produced satisfactory predictions for the streamwise Reynolds stress component, while a qualitative agreement with the experiments was achieved for the transverse component. Regarding the shear stress component, ASBM-SA closure provides improved predictions compared to SA in the entire domain.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00579v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The structure of deterministic mass and surface fractals: theory and
  methods of analyzing small-angle scattering data"	A. Yu. Cherny	E. M. Anitas, V. A. Osipov, A. I. Kuklin	2019-01-29 20:05:33	Small-angle scattering (SAS) of X-rays, neutrons or light from ensembles of randomly oriented and placed deterministic fractal structures are studied theoretically. In the standard analysis, a very few parameters can be determined from SAS data: the fractal dimension, and the lower and upper limits of the fractal range. The self-similarity of deterministic structures allows one to obtain additional characteristics of their spatial structures. The paper considers models which can describe accurately SAS from such structures. The developed models of deterministic fractals offer many advantages in describing fractal systems, including the possibility to extract additional structural information, an analytic description of SAS intensity, and effective computational algorithms. Generalized Cantor fractals and few of its variants are used as basic examples to illustrate the above concepts and to model physical samples with mass, surface, and multi-fractal structures. The differences between the deterministic and random fractal structures in analyzing SAS data are emphasized. Several limitations are identified in order to motivate future investigations of deterministic fractal structures.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C9CP00783K	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Less Memory, Faster Speed: Refining Self-Attention Module for Image
  Reconstruction"	Zheng Wang	Jianwu Li, Ge Song, Tieling Li	2019-05-20 11:43:37	Self-attention (SA) mechanisms can capture effectively global dependencies in deep neural networks, and have been applied to natural language processing and image processing successfully. However, SA modules for image reconstruction have high time and space complexity, which restrict their applications to higher-resolution images. In this paper, we refine the SA module in self-attention generative adversarial networks (SAGAN) via adapting a non-local operation, revising the connectivity among the units in SA module and re-implementing its computational pattern, such that its time and space complexity is reduced from $\text{O}(n^2)$ to $\text{O}(n)$, but it is still equivalent to the original SA module. Further, we explore the principles behind the module and discover that our module is a special kind of channel attention mechanisms. Experimental results based on two benchmark datasets of image reconstruction, verify that under the same computational environment, two models can achieve comparable effectiveness for image reconstruction, but the proposed one runs faster and takes up less memory space.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08008v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"On the Convergence of Consensus Algorithms with Markovian Noise and
  Gradient Bias"	Hoi-To Wai	Aucun	2020-08-18 10:29:33	This paper presents a finite time convergence analysis for a decentralized stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. The scheme generalizes several algorithms for decentralized machine learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our proof technique involves separating the iterates into their respective consensual parts and consensus error. The consensus error is bounded in terms of the stationarity of the consensual part, while the updates of the consensual part can be analyzed as a perturbed SA scheme. Under the Markovian noise and time varying communication graph assumptions, the decentralized SA scheme has an expected convergence rate of ${\cal O}(\log T/ \sqrt{T} )$, where $T$ is the iteration number, in terms of squared norms of gradient for nonlinear SA with smooth but non-convex cost function. This rate is comparable to the best known performances of SA in a centralized setting with a non-convex potential function.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07841v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Learning Synergistic Attention for Light Field Salient Object Detection	Yi Zhang	Geng Chen, Qian Chen, Yujia Sun, Yong Xia, Olivier Deforges, Wassim Hamidouche, Lu Zhang	2021-04-28 17:56:04	We propose a novel Synergistic Attention Network (SA-Net) to address the light field salient object detection by establishing a synergistic effect between multi-modal features with advanced attention mechanisms. Our SA-Net exploits the rich information of focal stacks via 3D convolutional neural networks, decodes the high-level features of multi-modal light field data with two cascaded synergistic attention modules, and predicts the saliency map using an effective feature fusion module in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets show that our SA-Net outperforms 28 state-of-the-art models, sufficiently demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

"Parmsurv: a SAS Macro for Flexible Parametric Survival Analysis with
  Long-Term Predictions"	Han Fu	Shahrul Mt-Isa, Richard Baumgartner, William Malbecq	2021-06-26 23:24:19	Health economic evaluations often require predictions of survival rates beyond the follow-up period. Parametric survival models can be more convenient for economic modelling than the Cox model. The generalized gamma (GG) and generalized F (GF) distributions are extensive families that contain almost all commonly used distributions with various hazard shapes and arbitrary complexity. In this study, we present a new SAS macro for implementing a wide variety of flexible parametric models including the GG and GF distributions and their special cases, as well as the Gompertz distribution. Proper custom distributions are also supported. Different from existing SAS procedures, this macro not only supports regression on the location parameter but also on ancillary parameters, which greatly increases model flexibility. In addition, the SAS macro supports weighted regression, stratified regression and robust inference. This study demonstrates with several examples how the SAS macro can be used for flexible survival modeling and extrapolation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14109v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Iterative, Deep, and Unsupervised Synthetic Aperture Sonar Image
  Segmentation"	Yung-Chen Sun	Isaac D. Gerg, Vishal Monga	2021-07-30 11:37:33	Deep learning has not been routinely employed for semantic segmentation of seabed environment for synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery due to the implicit need of abundant training data such methods necessitate. Abundant training data, specifically pixel-level labels for all images, is usually not available for SAS imagery due to the complex logistics (e.g., diver survey, chase boat, precision position information) needed for obtaining accurate ground-truth. Many hand-crafted feature based algorithms have been proposed to segment SAS in an unsupervised fashion. However, there is still room for improvement as the feature extraction step of these methods is fixed. In this work, we present a new iterative unsupervised algorithm for learning deep features for SAS image segmentation. Our proposed algorithm alternates between clustering superpixels and updating the parameters of a convolutional neural network (CNN) so that the feature extraction for image segmentation can be optimized. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a realistic benchmark dataset. Our results show that the performance of our proposed method is considerably better than current state-of-the-art methods in SAS image segmentation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14563v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Right Ventricular Segmentation from Short- and Long-Axis MRIs via
  Information Transition"	Lei Li	Wangbin Ding, Liqun Huang, Xiahai Zhuang	2021-09-05 21:39:27	Right ventricular (RV) segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial step for cardiac morphology and function analysis. However, automatic RV segmentation from MRI is still challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous intensity, the complex variable shapes, and the unclear RV boundary. Moreover, current methods for the RV segmentation tend to suffer from performance degradation at the basal and apical slices of MRI. In this work, we propose an automatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA) views is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via information transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation from LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for better segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding ambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We tested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs. Our experimental results show that including LA views can be effective to improve the accuracy of the SA segmentation. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/NanYoMy/MMs-2.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02171v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
UFO-ViT: High Performance Linear Vision Transformer without Softmax	Jeong-geun Song	Aucun	2021-09-29 12:32:49	Vision transformers have become one of the most important models for computer vision tasks. Although they outperform prior works, they require heavy computational resources on a scale that is quadratic to $N$. This is a major drawback of the traditional self-attention (SA) algorithm. Here, we propose the Unit Force Operated Vision Transformer (UFO-ViT), a novel SA mechanism that has linear complexity. The main approach of this work is to eliminate nonlinearity from the original SA. We factorize the matrix multiplication of the SA mechanism without complicated linear approximation. By modifying only a few lines of code from the original SA, the proposed models outperform most transformer-based models on image classification and dense prediction tasks on most capacity regimes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14382v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Sequential Addressing Subsampling Method for Massive Data Analysis
  under Memory Constraint"	Rui Pan	Yingqiu Zhu, Baishan Guo, Xuening Zhu, Hansheng Wang	2021-10-03 06:20:47	The emergence of massive data in recent years brings challenges to automatic statistical inference. This is particularly true if the data are too numerous to be read into memory as a whole. Accordingly, new sampling techniques are needed to sample data from a hard drive. In this paper, we propose a sequential addressing subsampling (SAS) method, that can sample data directly from the hard drive. The newly proposed SAS method is time saving in terms of addressing cost compared to that of the random addressing subsampling (RAS) method. Estimators (e.g., the sample mean) based on the SAS subsamples are constructed, and their properties are studied. We conduct a series of simulation studies to verify the finite sample performance of the proposed SAS estimators. The time cost is also compared between the SAS and RAS methods. An analysis of the airline data is presented for illustration purpose.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00936v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
X-ViT: High Performance Linear Vision Transformer without Softmax	Jeonggeun Song	Heung-Chang Lee	2022-05-27 07:47:22	Vision transformers have become one of the most important models for computer vision tasks. Although they outperform prior works, they require heavy computational resources on a scale that is quadratic to the number of tokens, $N$. This is a major drawback of the traditional self-attention (SA) algorithm. Here, we propose the X-ViT, ViT with a novel SA mechanism that has linear complexity. The main approach of this work is to eliminate nonlinearity from the original SA. We factorize the matrix multiplication of the SA mechanism without complicated linear approximation. By modifying only a few lines of code from the original SA, the proposed models outperform most transformer-based models on image classification and dense prediction tasks on most capacity regimes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13805v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Unpopular SAS Tips/Advice	FaZe_Butterfly	Aucun	2023-06-01 19:27:19	There’s probably a thread similar to this already but that’s okay. As SAS is upon us, I was thinking of some tips I’ve never heard anyone give but think are golden and can make such a difference.   1. Do I have space for this? The more I buy, the more I gotta make room for.   2. This is another product I will have to factor into my inventory and use up. Can I commit to that? Will this just end up being another declutter or trash item?   3. Can I do without this? I have something pretty similar so is this reallyyy necessary?   And so forth… what’s your unpopular SAS tip/piece of advice?	https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/13xqtsd/unpopular_sas_tipsadvice/		reddit	13xqtsd	bathandbodyworks	232.0	232.0	158.0	SAS

I know R and python already so I was like, sure guess I’ll learn SAS and add it to the tool kit. But I just hate it so much.   Does anyone know how in demand this skill is for data scientists?

Molly Rose calls Milwaukee and Phoenix terrible cities on First take, SAS, Max Kellerman and Michael Wilbon push the same message.

They have Devin Booker who many compare to a modern day Kobe and CP3 on the suns yet they only focus on calling their city terrible.  &#x200B;  It even went as far as SAS saying that he is rooting for the hawks so he doesn't have to go to Milwaukee, mentioning how he'd never root for Atlanta except this time.  &#x200B;  **Some extra info found on twitter:**  [Doug Russell (FOX Wisconsin) saying the last time SAS and Wilbon were in Milwaukee to cover the nba they never left the press room, not even to watch the game.](https://twitter.com/DougRussell/status/1407485823000403972?s=20)  &#x200B;  Edit:  Damien Woody, not Michael Wilbon.	https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o6d3mh/molly_rose_calls_milwaukee_and_phoenix_terrible/		reddit	o6d3mh	nba	4870.0	4870.0	2211.0	Damien Woody Not Wilbon
