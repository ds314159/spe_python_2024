The happiness paradox: your friends are happier than you	Johan Bollen	Bruno Gonçalves, Ingrid van de Leemput, Guangchen Ruan	2016-02-08 17:46:18	Most individuals in social networks experience a so-called Friendship Paradox: they are less popular than their friends on average. This effect may explain recent findings that widespread social network media use leads to reduced happiness. However the relation between popularity and happiness is poorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not necessarily imply a Happiness paradox where most individuals are less happy than their friends. Here we report the first direct observation of a significant Happiness Paradox in a large-scale online social network of $39,110$ Twitter users. Our results reveal that popular individuals are indeed happier and that a majority of individuals experience a significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect is shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness, and the fact that users cluster assortatively by level of happiness. Our results indicate that the topology of online social networks and the distribution of happiness in some populations can cause widespread psycho-social effects that affect the well-being of billions of individuals.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02665v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happiness and the productivity of software engineers	Daniel Graziotin	Fabian Fagerholm	2019-04-16 13:11:34	Software companies and startups often follow the idea of flourishing happiness among developers. Perks, playground rooms, free breakfast, remote office options, sports facilities near the companies, company retreats, you name it. The rationale is that happy developers should be more productive and also retained.   But is it the case that happy software engineers are more productive? Moreover, are perks the way to go to make developers happy? Are developers happy at all? What are the consequences of unhappiness among software engineers?   These questions are important to ask both from the perspective of productivity and from the perspective of sustainable software development and well-being in the workplace. Managers, team leaders, as well as team members should be interested in these concerns.   This chapter provides an overview of our studies on the happiness of software developers. You will learn why it is important to make software developers happy, how happy they really are, what makes them unhappy, and what is expected regarding happiness and productivity while developing software.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08239v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
If You're Happy, Then You Know It: The Logic of Happiness... and Sadness	Sanaz Azimipour	Pavel Naumov	2021-01-02 17:42:19	The article proposes a formal semantics of happiness and sadness modalities in imperfect information setting. It shows that these modalities are not definable through each other and gives a sound and complete axiomatization of their properties.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00485v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Classify Sina Weibo users into High or Low happiness Groups Using
  Linguistic and Behavior Features"	Jingying Wang	Tianli Liu, Tingshao Zhu, Lei Zhang, Bibo Hao, Zhenxiang Chen	2015-07-07 13:24:34	It's of great importance to measure happiness of social network users, but the existing method based on questionnaires suffers from high costs and low efficiency. This paper aims at identifying social network users' happiness level based on their Web behavior. We recruited 548 participants to fill in the Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI) and divided them into two groups with high/low OHI score. We downloaded each Weibo user's data by calling API, and extracted 103 linguistic and behavior features. 24 features are identified with significant difference between high and low happiness groups. We trained a Decision Tree on these 24 features to make the prediction of high/low happiness group. The decision tree can be used to identify happiness level of any new social network user based on linguistic and behavior features. The Decision Tree can achieve 67.7% on precision. Although the capability of our Decision Tree is not ideal, classifying happiness via linguistic and behavior features on the Internet is proved to be feasible.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01796v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Introspecting the Happiness amongst University Students using Machine
  Learning"	Sakshi Ranjan	Pooja Priyadarshini, Subhankar Mishra	2023-12-14 06:28:31	Happiness underlines the intuitive constructs of a specified population based on positive psychological outcomes. It is the cornerstone of the cognitive skills and exploring university student's happiness has been the essence of the researchers lately. In this study, we have analyzed the university student's happiness and its facets using statistical distribution charts; designing research questions. Furthermore, regression analysis, machine learning, and clustering algorithms were applied on the world happiness dataset and university student's dataset for training and testing respectively. Philosophy was the happiest department while Sociology the saddest; average happiness score being 2.8 and 2.44 respectively. Pearson coefficient of correlation was 0.74 for Health. Predicted happiness score was 5.2 and the goodness of model fit was 51%. train and test error being 0.52, 0.47 respectively. On a Confidence Interval(CI) of 5% p-value was least for Campus Environment(CE) and University Reputation(UR) and maximum for Extra-curricular Activities(ECA) and Work Balance(WB) (i.e. 0.184 and 0.228 respectively). RF with Clustering got the highest accuracy(89%) and F score(0.98) and the least error(17.91%), hence turned out to be best for our study	http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10092v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On finding the smallest happy numbers of any heights	Gabriel Lapointe	Aucun	2019-04-26 20:04:04	This paper focuses on finding the smallest happy number for each height in any numerical base. Using the properties of the height, we deduce a recursive relationship between the smallest happy number and the height where the initial height is function of the numerical base. With the usage of the recursive relationship, we build an algorithm that exploits the properties of the height in order to find all of those smallest happy numbers with unknown height. However, with the modular arithmetic, we conclude on an equation that calculates the smallest happy numbers based on known heights for binary and ternary bases.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12032v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Happy places or happy people? A multi-level modelling approach to the
  analysis of happiness and well-being"	Dimitris Ballas	Mark Tranmer	2008-08-07 11:15:27	This paper aims to enhance our understanding of substantive questions regarding self-reported happiness and well-being through the specification and use of multi-level models. To date, there have been numerous quantitative research studies of the happiness of individuals, based on single-level regression models, where typically a happiness index is related to a set of explanatory variables. There are also several single-level studies comparing aggregate happiness levels between countries. Nevertheless, there have been very few studies that attempt to simultaneously take into account variations in happiness and well-being at several different levels, such as individual, household, and area. Here, multilevel models are used with data from the British Household Panel Survey to assess the nature and extent of variations in happiness and well-being to determine the relative importance of the area (district, region), household and individual characteristics on these outcomes. Moreover, having taken into account the characteristics at these different levels in the multilevel models, the paper shows how it is possible to identify any areas that are associated with especially positive or negative feelings of happiness and well-being.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1001v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
What happens when software developers are (un)happy	Daniel Graziotin	Fabian Fagerholm, Xiaofeng Wang, Pekka Abrahamsson	2017-07-03 07:48:08	The growing literature on affect among software developers mostly reports on the linkage between happiness, software quality, and developer productivity. Understanding happiness and unhappiness in all its components -- positive and negative emotions and moods -- is an attractive and important endeavor. Scholars in industrial and organizational psychology have suggested that understanding happiness and unhappiness could lead to cost-effective ways of enhancing working conditions, job performance, and to limiting the occurrence of psychological disorders. Our comprehension of the consequences of (un)happiness among developers is still too shallow, being mainly expressed in terms of development productivity and software quality. In this paper, we study what happens when developers are happy and unhappy while developing software. Qualitative data analysis of responses given by 317 questionnaire participants identified 42 consequences of unhappiness and 32 of happiness. We found consequences of happiness and unhappiness that are beneficial and detrimental for developers' mental well-being, the software development process, and the produced artifacts. Our classification scheme, available as open data enables new happiness research opportunities of cause-effect type, and it can act as a guideline for practitioners for identifying damaging effects of unhappiness and for fostering happiness on the job.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2018.02.041	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Urban green space and happiness in developed countries	Oh-Hyun Kwon	Inho Hong, Jeasurk Yang, Donghee Yvette Wohn, Woo-Sung Jung, Meeyoung Cha	2021-01-04 07:13:33	Urban green space has been regarded as contributing to citizen happiness by promoting physical and mental health. However, how urban green space and happiness are related across many countries of different socioeconomic conditions has not been explained well. By measuring urban green space score (UGS) from high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of 90 global cities that in total cover 179,168 km$^2$ and include 230 million people in 60 developed countries, we reveal that the amount of urban green space and the GDP can explain the happiness level of the country. More precisely, urban green space and GDP are each individually associated with happiness; happiness in the 30 wealthiest countries is explained only by urban green space, whereas GDP alone explains happiness in the 30 other countries in this study. Lastly, we further show that the relationship between urban green space and happiness is mediated by social support and that GDP moderates the relationship between social support and happiness, which underlines the importance of maintaining urban green space as a place for social cohesion in promoting people's happiness.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00278-7	cs	arxiv					0.0	
HappyDB: A Corpus of 100,000 Crowdsourced Happy Moments	Akari Asai	Sara Evensen, Behzad Golshan, Alon Halevy, Vivian Li, Andrei Lopatenko, Daniela Stepanov, Yoshihiko Suhara, Wang-Chiew Tan, Yinzhan Xu	2018-01-23 19:49:58	The science of happiness is an area of positive psychology concerned with understanding what behaviors make people happy in a sustainable fashion. Recently, there has been interest in developing technologies that help incorporate the findings of the science of happiness into users' daily lives by steering them towards behaviors that increase happiness. With the goal of building technology that can understand how people express their happy moments in text, we crowd-sourced HappyDB, a corpus of 100,000 happy moments that we make publicly available. This paper describes HappyDB and its properties, and outlines several important NLP problems that can be studied with the help of the corpus. We also apply several state-of-the-art analysis techniques to analyze HappyDB. Our results demonstrate the need for deeper NLP techniques to be developed which makes HappyDB an exciting resource for follow-on research.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07746v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Network Learning Approaches to study World Happiness	Siddharth Dixit	Meghna Chaudhary, Niteesh Sahni	2020-07-17 18:29:49	The United Nations in its 2011 resolution declared the pursuit of happiness a fundamental human goal and proposed public and economic policies centered around happiness. In this paper we used 2 types of computational strategies viz. Predictive Modelling and Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model the processed historical happiness index data of 156 nations published by UN since 2012. We attacked the problem of prediction using General Regression Neural Networks (GRNNs) and show that it out performs other state of the art predictive models. To understand causal links amongst key features that have been proven to have a significant impact on world happiness, we first used a manual discretization scheme to discretize continuous variables into 3 levels viz. Low, Medium and High. A consensus World Happiness BN structure was then fixed after amalgamating information by learning 10000 different BNs using bootstrapping. Lastly, exact inference through conditional probability queries was used on this BN to unravel interesting relationships among the important features affecting happiness which would be useful in policy making.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09181v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Measuring Happiness Around the World Through Artificial Intelligence	Rustem Ozakar	Rafet Efe Gazanfer, Y. Sinan Hanay	2020-11-25 07:12:11	In this work, we analyze the happiness levels of countries using an unbiased emotion detector, artificial intelligence (AI). To date, researchers proposed many factors that may affect happiness such as wealth, health and safety. Even though these factors all seem relevant, there is no clear consensus between sociologists on how to interpret these, and the models to estimate the cost of these utilities include some assumptions. Researchers in social sciences have been working on determination of the happiness levels in society and exploration of the factors correlated with it through polls and different statistical methods. In our work, by using artificial intelligence, we introduce a different and relatively unbiased approach to this problem. By using AI, we make no assumption about what makes a person happy, and leave the decision to AI to detect the emotions from the faces of people collected from publicly available street footages. We analyzed the happiness levels in eight different cities around the world through available footage on the Internet and found out that there is no statistically significant difference between countries in terms of happiness.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12548v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Algorithms and hardness results for happy coloring problems	N. R. Aravind	Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram, Anjeneya Swami Kare, Juho Lauri	2017-05-23 14:04:40	In a vertex-colored graph, an edge is happy if its endpoints have the same color. Similarly, a vertex is happy if all its incident edges are happy. Motivated by the computation of homophily in social networks, we consider the algorithmic aspects of the following Maximum Happy Edges (k-MHE) problem: given a partially k-colored graph G, find an extended full k-coloring of G maximizing the number of happy edges. When we want to maximize the number of happy vertices, the problem is known as Maximum Happy Vertices (k-MHV). We further study the complexity of the problems and their weighted variants. For instance, we prove that for every k >= 3, both problems are NP-complete for bipartite graphs and k-MHV remains hard for split graphs. In terms of exact algorithms, we show both problems can be solved in time O*(2^n), and give an even faster O*(1.89^n)-time algorithm when k = 3. From a parameterized perspective, we give a linear vertex kernel for Weighted k-MHE, where edges are weighted and the goal is to obtain happy edges of at least a specified total weight. Finally, we prove both problems are solvable in polynomial-time when the graph has bounded treewidth or bounded neighborhood diversity.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08282v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Definition of Happiness for Reinforcement Learning Agents	Mayank Daswani	Jan Leike	2015-05-18 03:14:39	What is happiness for reinforcement learning agents? We seek a formal definition satisfying a list of desiderata. Our proposed definition of happiness is the temporal difference error, i.e. the difference between the value of the obtained reward and observation and the agent's expectation of this value. This definition satisfies most of our desiderata and is compatible with empirical research on humans. We state several implications and discuss examples.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04497v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Parameterized Complexity of Happy Colorings	Neeldhara Misra	I. Vinod Reddy	2017-08-13 04:52:27	Consider a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a coloring $c$ of vertices with colors from $[\ell]$. A vertex $v$ is said to be happy with respect to $c$ if $c(v) = c(u)$ for all neighbors $u$ of $v$. Further, an edge $(u,v)$ is happy if $c(u) = c(v)$. Given a partial coloring $c$ of $V$, the Maximum Happy Vertex (Edge) problem asks for a total coloring of $V$ extending $c$ to all vertices of $V$ that maximises the number of happy vertices (edges). Both problems are known to be NP-hard in general even when $\ell = 3$, and is polynomially solvable when $\ell = 2$. In [IWOCA 2016] it was shown that both problems are polynomially solvable on trees, and for arbitrary $k$, it was shown that MHE is \NPH{} on planar graphs and is \FPT{} parameterized by the number of precolored vertices and branchwidth.   We continue the study of this problem from a parameterized prespective. Our focus is on both structural and standard parameterizations. To begin with, we establish that the problems are \FPT{} when parameterized by the treewidth and the number of colors used in the precoloring, which is a potential improvement over the total number of precolored vertices. Further, we show that both the vertex and edge variants of the problem is \FPT{} when parameterized by vertex cover and distance-to-clique parameters. We also show that the problem of maximizing the number of happy edges is \FPT{} when parameterized by the standard parameter, the number of happy edges. We show that the maximum happy vertex (edge) problem is \NPH{} on split graphs and bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on cographs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03853v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On the Density of Happy Numbers	Justin Gilmer	Aucun	2011-10-17 21:55:34	The happy function $H: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ sends a positive integer to the sum of the squares of its digits. A number $x$ is said to be happy if the sequence $\{H^n(x)\}^\infty_{n=1}$ eventually reaches one. A basic open question regarding happy numbers is what bounds on the density can be proved. This paper uses probabilistic methods to reduce this problem to experimentally finding suitably large intervals containing a high (or low) density of happy numbers as a subset. Specifically we show that $\bar{d} > .18577$ and $\underline{d} < .1138$. We also prove that the asymptotic density does not exist for several generalizations of happy numbers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3836v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Linguistic Reflexes of Well-Being and Happiness in Echo	Jiaqi Wu	Marilyn Walker, Pranav Anand, Steve Whittaker	2017-08-31 22:03:53	Different theories posit different sources for feelings of well-being and happiness. Appraisal theory grounds our emotional responses in our goals and desires and their fulfillment, or lack of fulfillment. Self Determination theory posits that the basis for well-being rests on our assessment of our competence, autonomy, and social connection. And surveys that measure happiness empirically note that people require their basic needs to be met for food and shelter, but beyond that tend to be happiest when socializing, eating or having sex. We analyze a corpus of private microblogs from a well-being application called ECHO, where users label each written post about daily events with a happiness score between 1 and 9. Our goal is to ground the linguistic descriptions of events that users experience in theories of well-being and happiness, and then examine the extent to which different theoretical accounts can explain the variance in the happiness scores. We show that recurrent event types, such as OBLIGATION and INCOMPETENCE, which affect people's feelings of well-being are not captured in current lexical or semantic resources.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00094v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On Happy Colorings, Cuts, and Structural Parameterizations	Ivan Bliznets	Danil Sagunov	2019-07-14 06:28:28	We study the Maximum Happy Vertices and Maximum Happy Edges problems. The former problem is a variant of clusterization, where some vertices have already been assigned to clusters. The second problem gives a natural generalization of Multiway Uncut, which is the complement of the classical Multiway Cut problem. Due to their fundamental role in theory and practice, clusterization and cut problems has always attracted a lot of attention. We establish a new connection between these two classes of problems by providing a reduction between Maximum Happy Vertices and Node Multiway Cut. Moreover, we study structural and distance to triviality parameterizations of Maximum Happy Vertices and Maximum Happy Edges. Obtained results in these directions answer questions explicitly asked in four works: Agrawal '17, Aravind et al. '16, Choudhari and Reddy '18, Misra and Reddy '17.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06172v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Shortest Paths in Portalgons	Maarten Löffler	Tim Ophelders, Frank Staals, Rodrigo I. Silveira	2023-03-15 21:06:45	Any surface that is intrinsically polyhedral can be represented by a collection of simple polygons (fragments), glued along pairs of equally long oriented edges, where each fragment is endowed with the geodesic metric arising from its Euclidean metric. We refer to such a representation as a portalgon, and we call two portalgons equivalent if the surfaces they represent are isometric. We analyze the complexity of shortest paths in portalgons. We call a fragment happy if any shortest path on the portalgon visits it at most a constant number of times. A portalgon is happy if all of its fragments are happy. We present an efficient algorithm to compute shortest paths on happy portalgons. The number of times that a shortest path visits a fragment is unbounded in general. We contrast this by showing that the intrinsic Delaunay triangulation of any polyhedral surface corresponds to a happy portalgon. Since computing the intrinsic Delaunay triangulation may be inefficient, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute happy portalgons for a restricted class of portalgons.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08937v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On the Unhappiness of Software Developers	Daniel Graziotin	Fabian Fagerholm, Xiaofeng Wang, Pekka Abrahamsson	2017-03-15 08:07:39	The happy-productive worker thesis states that happy workers are more productive. Recent research in software engineering supports the thesis, and the ideal of flourishing happiness among software developers is often expressed among industry practitioners. However, the literature suggests that a cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be to limit unhappiness. Psychological disorders such as job burnout and anxiety could also be reduced by limiting the negative experiences of software developers. Simultaneously, a baseline assessment of (un)happiness and knowledge about how developers experience it are missing. In this paper, we broaden the understanding of unhappiness among software developers in terms of (1) the software developer population distribution of (un)happiness, and (2) the causes of unhappiness while developing software. We conducted a large-scale quantitative and qualitative survey, incorporating a psychometrically validated instrument for measuring (un)happiness, with 2220 developers, yielding a rich and balanced sample of 1318 complete responses. Our results indicate that software developers are a slightly happy population, but the need for limiting the unhappiness of developers remains. We also identified 219 factors representing causes of unhappiness while developing software. Our results, which are available as open data, can act as guidelines for practitioners in management positions and developers in general for fostering happiness on the job. We suggest considering happiness in future studies of both human and technical aspects in software engineering.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3084226.3084242	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happiness Pursuit: Personality Learning in a Society of Agents	Rafał Muszyński	Jun Wang	2017-11-29 19:24:53	Modeling personality is a challenging problem with applications spanning computer games, virtual assistants, online shopping and education. Many techniques have been tried, ranging from neural networks to computational cognitive architectures. However, most approaches rely on examples with hand-crafted features and scenarios. Here, we approach learning a personality by training agents using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model on rewards based on psychoanalysis, against hand-coded AI in the game of Pong. As a result, we obtain 4 agents, each with its own personality. Then, we define happiness of an agent, which can be seen as a measure of alignment with agent's objective function, and study it when agents play both against hand-coded AI, and against each other. We find that the agents that achieve higher happiness during testing against hand-coded AI, have lower happiness when competing against each other. This suggests that higher happiness in testing is a sign of overfitting in learning to interact with hand-coded AI, and leads to worse performance against agents with different personalities.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11068v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Measuring the happiness of large-scale written expression: Songs, Blogs,
  and Presidents"	Peter Sheridan Dodds	Christopher M. Danforth	2017-03-06 15:44:13	The importance of quantifying the nature and intensity of emotional states at the level of populations is evident: we would like to know how, when, and why individuals feel as they do if we wish, for example, to better construct public policy, build more successful organizations, and, from a scientific perspective, more fully understand economic and social phenomena. Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960's to the mid 1990's while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the equator.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10902-009-9150-9	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Does Yoga Make You Happy? Analyzing Twitter User Happiness using Textual
  and Temporal Information"	Tunazzina Islam	Dan Goldwasser	2020-12-05 03:30:49	"Although yoga is a multi-component practice to hone the body and mind and be known to reduce anxiety and depression, there is still a gap in understanding people's emotional state related to yoga in social media. In this study, we investigate the causal relationship between practicing yoga and being happy by incorporating textual and temporal information of users using Granger causality. To find out causal features from the text, we measure two variables (i) Yoga activity level based on content analysis and (ii) Happiness level based on emotional state. To understand users' yoga activity, we propose a joint embedding model based on the fusion of neural networks with attention mechanism by leveraging users' social and textual information. For measuring the emotional state of yoga users (target domain), we suggest a transfer learning approach to transfer knowledge from an attention-based neural network model trained on a source domain. Our experiment on Twitter dataset demonstrates that there are 1447 users where ""yoga Granger-causes happiness""."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378461	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Life is not Always Depressing: Exploring the Happy Moments of People
  Diagnosed with Depression"	Ana-Maria Bucur	Adrian Cosma, Liviu P. Dinu	2022-04-28 15:32:04	In this work, we explore the relationship between depression and manifestations of happiness in social media. While the majority of works surrounding depression focus on symptoms, psychological research shows that there is a strong link between seeking happiness and being diagnosed with depression. We make use of Positive-Unlabeled learning paradigm to automatically extract happy moments from social media posts of both controls and users diagnosed with depression, and qualitatively analyze them with linguistic tools such as LIWC and keyness information. We show that the life of depressed individuals is not always bleak, with positive events related to friends and family being more noteworthy to their lives compared to the more mundane happy events reported by control users.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13569v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happy Island	Larry McLerran	Aucun	2011-05-20 14:23:52	I discuss the phase diagram for QCD in the baryon chemical potential and temperature plane. I argue that there is a new phase of matter different from the deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma: Quarkyonic Matter. Quarkyonic Matter is confined and exists at densities parametrically large compared to the QCD scale, when the number of quark colors, $N_c$ is large. I motivate the possibility that Quarkyonic Matter is in an inhomogeneous phase, and is surrounded by lines of phase transitions, making a Happy Island in the $\mu_B$-T plane. I conjecture about the geography of Happy Island.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789814355766_0007	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"""Making you happy makes me happy"" -- Measuring Individual Mood with
  Smartwatches"	Pascal Budner	Joscha Eirich, Peter A. Gloor	2017-11-14 01:34:12	We introduce a system to measure individual happiness based on interpreting body sensors on smartwatches. In our prototype system we use a Pebble smartwatch to track activity, heartrate, light level, and GPS coordinates, and extend it with external information such as weather data, humidity, and day of the week. Training our machine learning-based mood prediction system using random forests with data manually entered into the smartwatch, we achieve prediction accuracy of up to 94%. We find that besides body signals, the weather data exerts a strong influence on mood. In addition our system also allows us to identify friends who are indicators of our positive or negative mood.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06134v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Temporal patterns of happiness and information in a global social
  network: Hedonometrics and Twitter"	Peter Sheridan Dodds	Kameron Decker Harris, Isabel M. Kloumann, Catherine A. Bliss, Christopher M. Danforth	2011-01-26 17:59:18	Individual happiness is a fundamental societal metric. Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we use a real-time, remote-sensing, non-invasive, text-based approach---a kind of hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage and we show how a highly robust metric can be constructed and defended.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026752	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Unsupervised Online Bayesian Autonomic Happy Internet-of-Things
  Management"	Rossi Kamal	Choong Seon Hong	2015-09-23 06:40:54	In Happy IoT, the revenue of service providers synchronizes to the unobservable and dynamic usage-contexts (e.g. emotion, environmental information, etc.) of Smart-device users. Hence, the usage-context-estimation from the unreliable Smart-device sensed data is justified as an unsupervised and non-linear optimization problem. Accordingly, Autonomic Happy IoT Management is aimed at attracting initial user-groups based on the common interests (i.e. recruitment ), then uncovering their latent usage-contexts from unreliable sensed data (i.e. revenue-renewal ) and synchronizing to usage-context dynamics (i.e. stochastic monetization). In this context, we have proposed an unsupervised online Bayesian mechanism, namely Whiz (Greek word, meaning Smart), in which, (a) once latent user-groups are initialized (i.e measurement model ), (b) usage-context is iteratively estimated from the unreliable sensed data (i.e. learning model ), (c) followed by online filtering of Bayesian knowledge about usage-context (i.e. filtering model ). Finally, we have proposed an Expectation Maximization (EM)-based iterative algorithm Whiz, which facilitates Happy IoT by solving (a) recruitment, (b) revenue-renewal and (c) stochastic- monetization problems with (a) measurement, (b) learning, and (c) filtering models, respectively.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06856v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Robust Ranking of Happiness Outcomes: A Median Regression Perspective	Le-Yu Chen	Ekaterina Oparina, Nattavudh Powdthavee, Sorawoot Srisuma	2019-02-20 18:50:07	Ordered probit and logit models have been frequently used to estimate the mean ranking of happiness outcomes (and other ordinal data) across groups. However, it has been recently highlighted that such ranking may not be identified in most happiness applications. We suggest researchers focus on median comparison instead of the mean. This is because the median rank can be identified even if the mean rank is not. Furthermore, median ranks in probit and logit models can be readily estimated using standard statistical softwares. The median ranking, as well as ranking for other quantiles, can also be estimated semiparametrically and we provide a new constrained mixed integer optimization procedure for implementation. We apply it to estimate a happiness equation using General Social Survey data of the US.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07696v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The infinite-dimensional HaPPY code: entanglement wedge reconstruction
  and dynamics"	Elliott Gesteau	Monica Jinwoo Kang	2020-05-12 18:00:00	We construct an infinite-dimensional analog of the HaPPY code as a growing series of stabilizer codes defined respective to their Hilbert spaces. The Hilbert spaces are related by isometric maps, which we define explicitly. We construct a Hamiltonian that is compatible with the infinite-dimensional HaPPY code and further study the stabilizer of our code, which has an inherent fractal structure. We use this result to study the dynamics of the code and map a nontrivial bulk Hamiltonian to the boundary. We find that the image of the mapping is scale invariant, but does not create any long-range entanglement in the boundary, therefore failing to reproduce the features of a CFT. This result shows the limits of the HaPPY code as a model of the AdS/CFT correspondence, but also hints that the relevance of quantum error correction in quantum gravity may not be limited to the CFT context.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05971v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
How (Un)Happiness Impacts on Software Engineers in Agile Teams?	Luís Felipe Amorim	Marcelo Marinho, Suzana Sampaio	2020-06-05 16:31:35	Information technology (IT) organizations are increasing the use of agile practices, which are based on a people-centred culture alongside the software development process. Thus, it is vital to understand the social and human factors of the individuals working in agile environments, such as happiness and unhappiness and how these factors impact this kind of environment. Therefore, five case-studies were developed inside agile projects, in a company that values innovation, aiming to identify how (un)happiness impacts software engineers in agile environments. According to the answers gathered from 67 participants through a survey, interviews and using a cross-analysis, happiness factors identified by agile teams were effective communication, motivated members, collaboration among members, proactive members, and present leaders.	http://dx.doi.org/10.5121/ijsea.2020.11303	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Lower Bounds for the Happy Coloring Problems	Ivan Bliznets	Danil Sagunov	2019-06-12 23:28:07	In this paper, we study the Maximum Happy Vertices and the Maximum Happy Edges problems (MHV and MHE for short). Very recently, the problems attracted a lot of attention and were studied in Agrawal '17, Aravind et al. '16, Choudhari and Reddy '18, Misra and Reddy '17. Main focus of our work is lower bounds on the computational complexity of these problems. Established lower bounds can be divided into the following groups: NP-hardness of the above guarantee parameterization, kernelization lower bounds (answering questions of Misra and Reddy '17), exponential lower bounds under the Set Cover Conjecture and the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and inapproximability results. Moreover, we present an $\mathcal{O}^*(\ell^k)$ randomized algorithm for MHV and an $\mathcal{O}^*(2^k)$ algorithm for MHE, where $\ell$ is the number of colors used and $k$ is the number of required happy vertices or edges. These algorithms cannot be improved to subexponential taking proved lower bounds into account.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05422v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"How COVID-19 influences healthcare workers' happiness: Panel data
  analysis in Japan"	Eiji Yamamura	Yoshiro Tsutsui	2021-01-25 20:50:34	Healthcare workers are more likely to be infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) because of unavoidable contact with infected people. Although they are equipped to reduce the likelihood of infection, their distress has increased. This study examines how COVID-19 influences healthcare workers' happiness, compared to other workers. We constructed panel data via Internet surveys during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan, from March to June 2020, by surveying the same respondents at different times. The survey period started before the state of emergency, and ended after deregulation. The key findings are as follows. (1) Overall, the happiness level of healthcare workers is lower than that of other workers. (2) The biggest disparity in happiness level, between healthcare workers and others, was observed after deregulation and not during the state of emergency. After deregulation, the difference was larger by 0.26 points, on an 11-point scale, than in the initial wave before the state of emergency.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10408v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"How happy is your web browsing? A model to quantify satisfaction of an
  Internet user, searching for desired information"	Anirban Banerji	Aniket Magarkar	2009-02-06 14:55:20	We feel happy when web-browsing operations provide us with necessary information; otherwise, we feel bitter. How to measure this happiness (or bitterness)? How does the profile of happiness grow and decay during the course of web-browsing? We propose a probabilistic framework that models evolution of user satisfaction, on top of his/her continuous frustration at not finding the required information. It is found that the cumulative satisfaction profile of a web-searching individual can be modeled effectively as the sum of random number of random terms, where each term is mutually independent random variable, originating from 'memoryless' Poisson flow. Evolution of satisfaction over the entire time interval of user's browsing was modeled with auto-correlation analysis. A utilitarian marker, magnitude of greater than unity of which describe happy web-searching operations; and an empirical limit that connects user's satisfaction with his frustration level - are proposed too. Presence of pertinent information in the very first page of a web-site and magnitude of the decay parameter of user satisfaction (frustration, irritation etc.), are found to be two key aspects that dominate web-browser's psychology. The proposed model employed different combination of decay parameter, searching time and number of helpful web-sites. Obtained results are found to match the results from three real-life case-studies.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2012.02.002	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Effect of Pets on Happiness: A Data-Driven Approach via Large-Scale
  Social Media"	Yuchen Wu	Jianbo Yuan, Quanzeng You, Jiebo Luo	2016-10-27 20:24:26	Psychologists have demonstrated that pets have a positive impact on owners' happiness. For example, lonely people are often advised to have a dog or cat to quell their social isolation. Conventional psychological research methods of analyzing this phenomenon are mostly based on surveys or self-reported questionnaires, which are time-consuming and lack of scalability. Utilizing social media as an alternative and complimentary resource could potentially address both issues and provide different perspectives on this psychological investigation. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach that exploits social media to study the effect of pets on owners' happiness. The proposed framework includes three major components: 1) collecting user-level data from Instagram consisting of about 300,000 images from 2905 users; 2) constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pets classification, and combined with timeline information, further identifying pet owners and the control group; 3) measuring the confidence score of happiness by detecting and analyzing selfie images. Furthermore, various factors of demographics are employed to analyze the fine-grained effects of pets on happiness. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and we believe that this approach can be applied to other related domains as a large-scale, high-confidence methodology of user activity analysis through social media.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09002v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happiness Entailment: Automating Suggestions for Well-Being	Sara Evensen	Yoshihiko Suhara, Alon Halevy, Vivian Li, Wang-Chiew Tan, Saran Mumick	2019-07-23 17:46:02	Understanding what makes people happy is a central topic in psychology. Prior work has mostly focused on developing self-reporting assessment tools for individuals and relies on experts to analyze the periodic reported assessments. One of the goals of the analysis is to understand what actions are necessary to encourage modifications in the behaviors of the individuals to improve their overall well-being. In this paper, we outline a complementary approach; on the assumption that the user journals her happy moments as short texts, a system can analyze these texts and propose sustainable suggestions for the user that may lead to an overall improvement in her well-being. We prototype one necessary component of such a system, the Happiness Entailment Recognition (HER) module, which takes as input a short text describing an event, a candidate suggestion, and outputs a determination about whether the suggestion is more likely to be good for this user based on the event described. This component is implemented as a neural network model with two encoders, one for the user input and one for the candidate actionable suggestion, with additional layers to capture psychologically significant features in the happy moment and suggestion.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10036v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Gauging the happiness benefit of US urban parks through Twitter	A. J. Schwartz	P. S. Dodds, J. P. M. O'Neil-Dunne, T. H. Ricketts, C. M. Danforth	2020-06-18 16:34:32	The relationship between nature contact and mental well-being has received increasing attention in recent years. While a body of evidence has accumulated demonstrating a positive relationship between time in nature and mental well-being, there have been few studies comparing this relationship in different locations over long periods of time. In this study, we estimate a happiness benefit, the difference in expressed happiness between in- and out-of-park tweets, for the 25 largest cities in the US by population. People write happier words during park visits when compared with non-park user tweets collected around the same time. While the words people write are happier in parks on average and in most cities, we find considerable variation across cities. Tweets are happier in parks at all times of the day, week, and year, not just during the weekend or summer vacation. Across all cities, we find that the happiness benefit is highest in parks larger than 100 acres. Overall, our study suggests the happiness benefit associated with park visitation is on par with US holidays such as Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10658v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Unhappy Developers: Bad for Themselves, Bad for Process, and Bad for
  Software Product"	Daniel Graziotin	Fabian Fagerholm, Xiaofeng Wang, Pekka Abrahamsson	2017-01-11 12:38:13	"Recent research in software engineering supports the ""happy-productive"" thesis, and the desire of flourishing happiness among programmers is often expressed by industry practitioners. Recent literature has suggested that a cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be to limit unhappiness of developers due to its negative impact. However, possible negative effects of unhappiness are still largely unknown in the software development context. In this paper, we present the first results from a study exploring the consequences of the unhappy developers. Using qualitative data analysis of the survey responses given by 181 participants, we identified 49 potential consequences of unhappiness while developing software. These results have several implications. While raising the awareness of the role of moods, emotions and feelings in software development, we foresee that our classification scheme will spawn new happiness studies linking causes and effects, and it can act as a guideline for developers and managers to foster happiness at work."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.104	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Consequences of Unhappiness While Developing Software	Daniel Graziotin	Fabian Fagerholm, Xiaofeng Wang, Pekka Abrahamsson	2017-01-20 13:48:10	The growing literature on affect among software developers mostly reports on the linkage between happiness, software quality, and developer productivity. Understanding the positive side of happiness -- positive emotions and moods -- is an attractive and important endeavor. Scholars in industrial and organizational psychology have suggested that also studying the negative side -- unhappiness -- could lead to cost-effective ways of enhancing working conditions, job performance, and to limiting the occurrence of psychological disorders. Our comprehension of the consequences of (un)happiness among developers is still too shallow, and is mainly expressed in terms of development productivity and software quality. In this paper, we attempt to uncover the experienced consequences of unhappiness among software developers. Using qualitative data analysis of the responses given by 181 questionnaire participants, we identified 49 consequences of unhappiness while doing software development. We found detrimental consequences on developers' mental well-being, the software development process, and the produced artifacts. Our classification scheme, available as open data, will spawn new happiness research opportunities of cause-effect type, and it can act as a guideline for practitioners for identifying damaging effects of unhappiness and for fostering happiness on the job.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SEmotion.2017.5	cs	arxiv					0.0	
HaPPY-Mine: Designing a Mining Reward Function	Lucianna Kiffer	Rajmohan Rajaraman	2021-03-22 23:28:07	In cryptocurrencies, the block reward is meant to serve as the incentive mechanism for miners to commit resources to create blocks and in effect secure the system. Existing systems primarily divide the reward in proportion to expended resources and follow one of two static models for total block reward: (i) a fixed reward for each block (e.g., Ethereum), or (ii) one where the block reward halves every set number of blocks (e.g., the Bitcoin model of halving roughly every 4 years) but otherwise remains fixed between halvings. In recent work, a game-theoretic analysis of the static model under asymmetric miner costs showed that an equilibrium always exists and is unique. Their analysis also reveals how asymmetric costs can lead to large-scale centralization in blockchain mining, a phenomenon that has been observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum and highlighted by other studies. In this work we introduce a novel family of mining reward functions, HaPPY-Mine (HAsh-Pegged Proportional Yield), which peg the value of the reward to the hashrate of the system, decreasing the reward as the hashrate increases. HaPPY-Mine distributes rewards in proportion to expended hashrate and inherits the safety properties of the generalized proportional reward function. We study HaPPY-Mine under a heterogeneous miner cost model and show that an equilibrium always exists with a unique set of miner participants and a unique total hashrate. Significantly, we prove that a HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is more decentralized than the static model equilibrium under a set of metrics including number of mining participants and hashrate distribution. Finally, we show that any HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is also safe against collusion and sybil attacks, and explore how the market value of the currency affects the equilibrium.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12229v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Aristotle Said ""Happiness is a State of Activity"" -- Predicting Mood
  through Body Sensing with Smartwatches"	P. A. Gloor	A. Fronzetti Colladon, F. Grippa, P. Budner, J. Eirich	2021-05-24 14:14:04	We measure and predict states of Activation and Happiness using a body sensing application connected to smartwatches. Through the sensors of commercially available smartwatches we collect individual mood states and correlate them with body sensing data such as acceleration, heart rate, light level data, and location, through the GPS sensor built into the smartphone connected to the smartwatch. We polled users on the smartwatch for seven weeks four times per day asking for their mood state. We found that both Happiness and Activation are negatively correlated with heart beats and with the levels of light. People tend to be happier when they are moving more intensely and are feeling less activated during weekends. We also found that people with a lower Conscientiousness and Neuroticism and higher Agreeableness tend to be happy more frequently. In addition, more Activation can be predicted by lower Openness to experience and higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Lastly, we find that tracking people's geographical coordinates might play an important role in predicting Happiness and Activation. The methodology we propose is a first step towards building an automated mood tracking system, to be used for better teamwork and in combination with social network analysis studies.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11518-018-5383-7	cs	arxiv					0.0

Although this theory is in quite a happy situation now, we wish to point out that more precise measurements of $M_W$ and $m_t$ in the future are crucial and they could come to require some new physics beyond it.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217732395000132	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Unsupervised Segmentation of Overlapping Cervical Cell Cytoplasm	S L Happy	Swarnadip Chatterjee, Debdoot Sheet	2015-05-21 04:24:48	Overlapping of cervical cells and poor contrast of cell cytoplasm are the major issues in accurate detection and segmentation of cervical cells. An unsupervised cell segmentation approach is presented here. Cell clump segmentation was carried out using the extended depth of field (EDF) image created from the images of different focal planes. A modified Otsu method with prior class weights is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the cell clumps. The cell cytoplasm was further segmented from cell clump depending upon the number of nucleus detected in that cell clump. Level set model was used for cytoplasm segmentation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05601v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Its focus lies on the investigation of previously proposed sentiment features in order to gain insight about the relevance of specific features on the one hand and the implications of their performance on the other hand. Therefore, we study various partitionings of novels, considering the highly variable concept of ""ending"". We also show that our approach, even though still rather simple, can potentially lead to substantial findings relevant to literary studies."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09028v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Competition May Increase Social Happiness in Bipartite Matching Problem	Yi-Xiu Kong	Guang-Hui Yuan, Lei Zhou, Rui-Jie Wu, Gui-Yuan Shi	2018-05-23 12:28:43	Bipartite matching problem is to study two disjoint groups of agents who need to be matched pairwise. It can be applied to many real-world scenarios and explain many social phenomena. In this article, we study the effect of competition on bipartite matching problem by introducing correlated wish list. The results show that proper competition can improve the overall happiness of society and also reduce the instability of the matching result of unequal sized bipartite matching.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/4092056	cs	arxiv					0.0

Algorithmic Aspects of Homophyly of Networks	Angsheng Li	Peng Zhang	2012-07-02 09:31:32	We investigate the algorithmic problems of the {\it homophyly phenomenon} in networks. Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a vertex coloring $c \colon V \rightarrow {1, 2, ..., k}$ of $G$, we say that a vertex $v\in V$ is {\it happy} if $v$ shares the same color with all its neighbors, and {\it unhappy}, otherwise, and that an edge $e\in E$ is {\it happy}, if its two endpoints have the same color, and {\it unhappy}, otherwise. Supposing $c$ is a {\it partial vertex coloring} of $G$, we define the Maximum Happy Vertices problem (MHV, for short) as to color all the remaining vertices such that the number of happy vertices is maximized, and the Maximum Happy Edges problem (MHE, for short) as to color all the remaining vertices such that the number of happy edges is maximized.   Let $k$ be the number of colors allowed in the problems. We show that both MHV and MHE can be solved in polynomial time if $k = 2$, and that both MHV and MHE are NP-hard if $k \geq 3$. We devise a $\max {1/k, \Omega(\Delta^{-3})}$-approximation algorithm for the MHV problem, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of vertices in the input graph, and a 1/2-approximation algorithm for the MHE problem. This is the first theoretical progress of these two natural and fundamental new problems.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0316v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Shortest Path to Happiness: Recommending Beautiful, Quiet, and Happy
  Routes in the City"	Daniele Quercia	Rossano Schifanella, Luca Maria Aiello	2014-07-03 19:47:19	When providing directions to a place, web and mobile mapping services are all able to suggest the shortest route. The goal of this work is to automatically suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant. To quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30 participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing insights for future work.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1031v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Global Alignment Kernel based Approach for Group-level Happiness
  Intensity Estimation"	Xiaohua Huang	Abhinav Dhall, Roland Goecke, Matti Pietikainen, Guoying Zhao	2018-09-03 20:23:30	With the progress in automatic human behavior understanding, analysing the perceived affect of multiple people has been recieved interest in affective computing community. Unlike conventional facial expression analysis, this paper primarily focuses on analysing the behaviour of multiple people in an image. The proposed method is based on support vector regression with the combined global alignment kernels (GAKs) to estimate the happiness intensity of a group of people. We first exploit Riesz-based volume local binary pattern (RVLBP) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based features for characterizing facial images. Furthermore, we propose to use the GAK for RVLBP and deep CNN features, respectively for explicitly measuring the similarity of two group-level images. Specifically, we exploit the global weight sort scheme to sort the face images from group-level image according to their spatial weights, making an efficient data structure to GAK. Lastly, we propose Multiple kernel learning based on three combination strategies for combining two respective GAKs based on RVLBP and deep CNN features, such that enhancing the discriminative ability of each GAK. Intensive experiments are performed on the challenging group-level happiness intensity database, namely HAPPEI. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves promising performance for group happiness intensity analysis, when compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03313v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Investigation of the Effect of Incidental Fear Privacy Behavioral
  Intention (Technical Report)"	Uchechi Phyllis Nwadike	Thomas Groß	2020-07-16 20:04:51	Background. Incidental emotions users feel during their online activities may alter their privacy behavioral intentions.   Aim. We investigate the effect of incidental affect (fear and happiness) on privacy behavioral intention.   Method. We recruited $330$ participants for a within-subjects experiment in three random-controlled user studies. The participants were exposed to three conditions \textsf{neutral}, \textsf{fear}, \textsf{happiness} with standardised stimuli videos for incidental affect induction. Fear and happiness were assigned in random order. The participants' privacy behavioural intentions (PBI) were measured followed by a Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X) manipulation check on self-reported affect. The PBI and PANAS-X were compared across treatment conditions.   Results. We observed a statistically significant difference in PBI and Protection Intention in neutral-fear and neutral-happy comparisons. However across fear and happy conditions, we did not observe any statistically significant change in PBI scores.   Conclusions. We offer the first systematic analysis of the impact of incidental affects on Privacy Behavioral Intention (PBI) and its sub-constructs. We are the first to offer a fine-grained analysis of neutral-affect comparisons and interactions offering insights in hitherto unexplained phenomena reported in the field.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08604v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Sequences of consecutive factoradic happy numbers	Joshua Carlson	Eva G. Goedhart, Pamela E. Harris	2019-12-04 15:10:13	Given a positive integer $n$, the factorial base representation of $n$ is given by $n=\sum_{i=1}^ka_i\cdot i!$, where $a_k\neq 0$ and $0\leq a_i\leq i$ for all $1\leq i\leq k$. For $e\geq 1$, we define $S_{e,!}:\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\to\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}$ by $S_{e,!}(0) = 0$ and $S_{e,!}(n)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_i^e$, for $n \neq 0$. For $\ell\geq 0$, we let $S_{e,!}^\ell(n)$ denote the $\ell$-th iteration of $S_{e,!}$, while $S_{e,!}^0(n)=n$. If $p\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ satisfies $S_{e,!}(p)=p$, then we say that $p$ is an $e$-power factoradic fixed point of $S_{e,!}$. Moreover, given $x\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, if $p$ is an $e$-power factoradic fixed point and if there exists $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ such that $S_{e,!}^\ell(x)=p$, then we say that $x$ is an $e$-power factoradic $p$-happy number. Note an integer $n$ is said to be an $e$-power factoradic happy number if it is an $e$-power factoradic $1$-happy number. In this paper, we prove that all positive integers are $1$-power factoradic happy and, for $2\leq e\leq 4$, we prove the existence of arbitrarily long sequences of $e$-power factoradic $p$-happy numbers. A curious result establishes that for any $e\geq 2$ the $e$-power factoradic fixed points of $S_{e,!}$ that are greater than $1$, always appear in sets of consecutive pairs. Our last contribution, provides the smallest sequences of $m$ consecutive $e$-power factoradic happy numbers for $2\leq e\leq 5$, for some values of $m$.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02044v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Approximating Regret Minimizing Sets: A Happiness Perspective	Phoomraphee Luenam	Yau Pun Chen, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong	2021-02-06 13:00:01	A Regret Minimizing Set (RMS) is a useful concept in which a smaller subset of a database is selected while mostly preserving the best scores along every possible utility function. In this paper, we study the $k$-Regret Minimizing Sets ($k$-RMS) and Average Regret Minimizing Sets (ARMS) problems. $k$-RMS selects $r$ records from a database such that the maximum regret ratio between the $k$-th best score in the database and the best score in the selected records for any possible utility function is minimized. Meanwhile, ARMS minimizes the average of this ratio within a distribution of utility functions. Particularly, we study approximation algorithms for $k$-RMS and ARMS from the perspective of approximating the happiness ratio, which is equivalent to one minus the regret ratio.   In this paper, we show that the problem of approximating the happiness of a $k$-RMS within any finite factor is NP-Hard when the dimensionality of the database is unconstrained and extend the result to an inapproximability proof for the regret. We then provide approximation algorithms for approximating the happiness of ARMS with better approximation ratios and time complexities than known algorithms for approximating the regret. We further provide dataset reduction schemes which can be used to reduce the runtime of existing heuristic based algorithms, as well as to derive polynomial-time approximation schemes for $k$-RMS when dimensionality is fixed. Finally, we provide experimental validation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03578v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Computing and Maintaining Provenance of Query Result Probabilities in
  Uncertain Knowledge Graphs"	Garima Gaur	Abhishek Dang, Arnab Bhattacharya, Srikanta Bedathur	2021-08-17 17:03:43	Knowledge graphs (KG) that model the relationships between entities as labeled edges (or facts) in a graph are mostly constructed using a suite of automated extractors, thereby inherently leading to uncertainty in the extracted facts. Modeling the uncertainty as probabilistic confidence scores results in a probabilistic knowledge graph. Graph queries over such probabilistic KGs require answer computation along with the computation of those result probabilities, aka, probabilistic inference. We propose a system, HAPPI (How Provenance of Probabilistic Inference), to handle such query processing. Complying with the standard provenance semiring model, we propose a novel commutative semiring to symbolically compute the probability of the result of a query. These provenance-polynomiallike symbolic expressions encode fine-grained information about the probability computation process. We leverage this encoding to efficiently compute as well as maintain the probability of results as the underlying KG changes. Focusing on a popular class of conjunctive basic graph pattern queries on the KG, we compare the performance of HAPPI against a possible-world model of computation and a knowledge compilation tool over two large datasets. We also propose an adaptive system that leverages the strengths of both HAPPI and compilation based techniques. Since existing systems for probabilistic databases mostly focus on query computation, they default to re-computation when facts in the KG are updated. HAPPI, on the other hand, does not just perform probabilistic inference and maintain their provenance, but also provides a mechanism to incrementally maintain them as the KG changes. We extend this maintainability as part of our proposed adaptive system.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07758v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Improved Parameterized Complexity of Happy Set Problems	Yosuke Mizutani	Blair D. Sullivan	2022-07-14 02:36:03	We present fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for two problems, Maximum Happy Set (MaxHS) and Maximum Edge Happy Set (MaxEHS)--also known as Densest k-Subgraph. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, MaxHS asks for a set $S$ of $k$ vertices such that the number of $\textit{happy vertices}$ with respect to $S$ is maximized, where a vertex $v$ is happy if $v$ and all its neighbors are in $S$. We show that MaxHS can be solved in time $\mathcal{O}\left(2^\textsf{mw} \cdot \textsf{mw} \cdot k^2 \cdot |V(G)|\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(8^\textsf{cw} \cdot k^2 \cdot |V(G)|\right)$, where $\textsf{mw}$ and $\textsf{cw}$ denote the $\textit{modular-width}$ and the $\textit{clique-width}$ of $G$, respectively. This resolves the open questions posed in literature. The MaxEHS problem is an edge-variant of MaxHS, where we maximize the number of $\textit{happy edges}$, the edges whose endpoints are in $S$. In this paper we show that MaxEHS can be solved in time $f(\textsf{nd})\cdot|V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(2^{\textsf{cd}}\cdot k^2 \cdot |V(G)|\right)$, where $\textsf{nd}$ and $\textsf{cd}$ denote the $\textit{neighborhood diversity}$ and the $\textit{cluster deletion number}$ of $G$, respectively, and $f$ is some computable function. This result implies that MaxEHS is also fixed-parameter tractable by $\textit{twin cover number}$.	http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.IPEC.2022.23	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Economic Determinants of Happiness	Teng Guo	Lingyi Hu	2011-12-25 23:52:15	Many scholars have recently begun to dispute the assumed link between individual wellbeing and economic conditions and the extent to which the latter matters (Easterlin, 1995; Stevenson and Wolfers 2008; Tella and MacCulloch 2008). This dilemma is empirically demonstrated in the Latin America Public Opinion Project (LAPOP, 2011), which surveyed North and Latin America in terms of perceived life satisfaction. Higher measures found in the less developed countries of Brazil, Costa Rica, and Panama than in North America pose an intriguing quandary to traditional economic theory. In light of this predicament this paper aims to construct a sensible measure of the national happiness level for the United States on a year by year basis; and regress this against indicators of the national economy to provide insight into this puzzling enigma between national happiness and economic forces	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5802v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Geography of Happiness: Connecting Twitter sentiment and expression,
  demographics, and objective characteristics of place"	Lewis Mitchell	Kameron Decker Harris, Morgan R. Frank, Peter Sheridan Dodds, Christopher M. Danforth	2013-02-14 03:26:42	We conduct a detailed investigation of correlations between real-time expressions of individuals made across the United States and a wide range of emotional, geographic, demographic, and health characteristics. We do so by combining (1) a massive, geo-tagged data set comprising over 80 million words generated over the course of several recent years on the social network service Twitter and (2) annually-surveyed characteristics of all 50 states and close to 400 urban populations. Among many results, we generate taxonomies of states and cities based on their similarities in word use; estimate the happiness levels of states and cities; correlate highly-resolved demographic characteristics with happiness levels; and connect word choice and message length with urban characteristics such as education levels and obesity rates. Our results show how social media may potentially be used to estimate real-time levels and changes in population-level measures such as obesity rates.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064417	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Real Time Facial Expression Classification System Using Local Binary
  Patterns"	S. L. Happy	Anjith George, Aurobinda Routray	2015-05-15 13:33:10	Facial expression analysis is one of the popular fields of research in human computer interaction (HCI). It has several applications in next generation user interfaces, human emotion analysis, behavior and cognitive modeling. In this paper, a facial expression classification algorithm is proposed which uses Haar classifier for face detection purpose, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) histogram of different block sizes of a face image as feature vectors and classifies various facial expressions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The algorithm is implemented in real time for expression classification since the computational complexity of the algorithm is small. A customizable approach is proposed for facial expression analysis, since the various expressions and intensity of expressions vary from person to person. The system uses grayscale frontal face images of a person to classify six basic emotions namely happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise and anger.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IHCI.2012.6481802	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Numbers and the Heights of their Happiness	May Mei	Andrew Read-McFarland	2015-11-04 19:16:52	A generalized happy function, $S_{e,b}$ maps a positive integer to the sum of its base $b$ digits raised to the $e^\text{th}$ power. We say that $x$ is a base $b$, $e$ power, height $h$, $u$ attracted number if $h$ is the smallest positive integer so that $S^{h}_{e,b}(x)=u$. Happy numbers are then base 10, 2 power, 1 attracted numbers of any height. Let $\sigma_{h,e,b}(u)$ denote the smallest height $h$, $u$ attracted number for a fixed base $b$ and exponent $e$ and let $g(e)$ denote the smallest number so that every integer can be written as $x_{1}^{e}+x_{2}^{e}+...+x_{g(e)}^{e}$ for some nonnegative integers $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{g(e)}$. In this paper we prove that if $p_{e,b}$ is the smallest nonnegative integer such that $b^{p_{e,b}}>g(e)$, $\displaystyle d=\left\lceil \frac{g(e)+1}{1-(\frac{b-2}{b-1})^{e}}+e+p_{e,b}\right\rceil$, and $\sigma_{h,e,b}(u)\geq b^{d}$, then $S_{e,b}(\sigma_{h+1,e,b}(u))=\sigma_{h,e,b}(u)$.	http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/involve.2018.11.235	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Sentiment Perception of Readers and Writers in Emoji use	Jose Berengueres	Dani Castro	2017-10-02 20:07:18	Previous research has traditionally analyzed emoji sentiment from the point of view of the reader of the content not the author. Here, we analyze emoji sentiment from the point of view of the author and present a emoji sentiment benchmark that was built from an employee happiness dataset where emoji happen to be annotated with daily happiness of the author of the comment. The data spans over 3 years, and 4k employees of 56 companies based in Barcelona. We compare sentiment of writers to readers. Results indicate that, there is an 82% agreement in how emoji sentiment is perceived by readers and writers. Finally, we report that when authors use emoji they report higher levels of happiness. Emoji use was not found to be correlated with differences in author moodiness.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00888v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Maximizing Happiness in Graphs of Bounded Clique-Width	Ivan Bliznets	Danil Sagunov	2020-03-10 09:42:16	Clique-width is one of the most important parameters that describes structural complexity of a graph. Probably, only treewidth is more studied graph width parameter. In this paper we study how clique-width influences the complexity of the Maximum Happy Vertices (MHV) and Maximum Happy Edges (MHE) problems. We answer a question of Choudhari and Reddy '18 about parameterization by the distance to threshold graphs by showing that MHE is NP-complete on threshold graphs. Hence, it is not even in XP when parameterized by clique-width, since threshold graphs have clique-width at most two. As a complement for this result we provide a $n^{\mathcal{O}(\ell \cdot \operatorname{cw})}$ algorithm for MHE, where $\ell$ is the number of colors and $\operatorname{cw}$ is the clique-width of the input graph. We also construct an FPT algorithm for MHV with running time $\mathcal{O}^*((\ell+1)^{\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{cw})})$, where $\ell$ is the number of colors in the input. Additionally, we show $\mathcal{O}(\ell n^2)$ algorithm for MHV on interval graphs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04605v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Virtual information system on working area	Spits Warnars	Aucun	2010-06-09 04:08:07	In order to get strategic positioning for competition in business organization, the information system must be ahead in this information age where the information as one of the weapons to win the competition and in the right hand the information will become a right bullet. The information system with the information technology support isn't enough if just only on internet or implemented with internet technology. The growth of information technology as tools for helping and making people easy to use must be accompanied by wanting to make fun and happy when they make contact with the information technology itself. Basically human like to play, since childhood human have been playing, free and happy and when human grow up they can't play as much as when human was in their childhood. We have to develop the information system which is not perform information system itself but can help human to explore their natural instinct for playing, making fun and happiness when they interact with the information system. Virtual information system is the way to present playing and having fun atmosphere on working area.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1701v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Limit Sets for Natural Extensions of Schelling's Segregation Model	Abhinav Singh	Dmitri Vainchtein, Howard Weiss	2010-06-14 15:11:48	Thomas Schelling developed an influential demographic model that illustrated how, even with relatively mild assumptions on each individual's nearest neighbor preferences, an integrated city would likely unravel to a segregated city, even if all individuals prefer integration. Individuals in Schelling's model cities are divided into two groups of equal number and each individual is 'happy' or 'unhappy' when the number of similar neighbors cross a simple threshold. In this manuscript we consider natural extensions of Schelling's original model to allow the two groups have different sizes and to allow different notions of happiness of an individual. We observe that differences in aggregation patterns of majority and minority groups are highly sensitive to the happiness threshold; for low threshold, the differences are small, and when the threshold is raised, striking new patterns emerge. We also observe that when individuals strongly prefer to live integrated neighborhoods, the final states exhibit a new tessellated-like structure.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2010.10.007	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Happy Together: Learning and Understanding Appraisal From Natural
  Language"	Arun Rajendran	Chiyu Zhang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed	2019-06-09 17:28:37	In this paper, we explore various approaches for learning two types of appraisal components from happy language. We focus on 'agency' of the author and the 'sociality' involved in happy moments based on the HappyDB dataset. We develop models based on deep neural networks for the task, including uni- and bi-directional long short-term memory networks, with and without attention. We also experiment with a number of novel embedding methods, such as embedding from neural machine translation (as in CoVe) and embedding from language models (as in ELMo). We compare our results to those acquired by several traditional machine learning methods. Our best models achieve 87.97% accuracy on agency and 93.13% accuracy on sociality, both of which are significantly higher than our baselines.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03677v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Analysis of Facial Feature Deformation using Optical Flow Algorithm	Dayang Nur Zulhijah Awang Jesemi	Hamimah Ujir, Irwandi Hipiny, Sarah Flora Samson Juan	2020-10-23 07:14:02	Facial features deformed according to the intended facial expression. Specific facial features are associated with specific facial expression, i.e. happy means the deformation of mouth. This paper presents the study of facial feature deformation for each facial expression by using an optical flow algorithm and segmented into three different regions of interest. The deformation of facial features shows the relation between facial the and facial expression. Based on the experiments, the deformations of eye and mouth are significant in all expressions except happy. For happy expression, cheeks and mouths are the significant regions. This work also suggests that different facial features' intensity varies in the way that they contribute to the recognition of the different facial expression intensity. The maximum magnitude across all expressions is shown by the mouth for surprise expression which is 9x10-4. While the minimum magnitude is shown by the mouth for angry expression which is 0.4x10-4.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12199v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Is happiness u-shaped in age everywhere? A methodological
  reconsideration for Europe"	David Bartram	Aucun	2021-08-31 08:23:53	"A recent contribution to research on age and well-being (Blanchflower 2021) found that the impact of age on happiness is ""u-shaped"" virtually everywhere: happiness declines towards middle age and subsequently rises, in almost all countries. This paper evaluates that finding for European countries, considering whether it is robust to alternative methodological approaches. The analysis here excludes control variables that are affected by age (noting that those variable are not themselves antecedents of age) and uses data from the entire adult age range (rather than using data only from respondents younger than 70). I also explore the relationship via models that do not impose a quadratic functional form. The paper shows that these alternate approaches do not lead us to perceive a u-shape ""everywhere"": u-shapes are evident for some countries, but for others the pattern is quite different."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13671v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"How People Respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter: A Comparative
  Analysis of Emotional Expressions from US and India"	Brandon Siyuan Loh	Raj Kumar Gupta, Ajay Vishwanath, Andrew Ortony, Yinping Yang	2023-03-19 04:05:10	The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed millions of lives worldwide and elicited heightened emotions. This study examines the expression of various emotions pertaining to COVID-19 in the United States and India as manifested in over 54 million tweets, covering the fifteen-month period from February 2020 through April 2021, a period which includes the beginnings of the huge and disastrous increase in COVID-19 cases that started to ravage India in March 2021. Employing pre-trained emotion analysis and topic modeling algorithms, four distinct types of emotions (fear, anger, happiness, and sadness) and their time- and location-associated variations were examined. Results revealed significant country differences and temporal changes in the relative proportions of fear, anger, and happiness, with fear declining and anger and happiness fluctuating in 2020 until new situations over the first four months of 2021 reversed the trends. Detected differences are discussed briefly in terms of the latent topics revealed and through the lens of appraisal theories of emotions, and the implications of the findings are discussed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10560v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Party Planning the Next True Happy New Year: Lunar Orbital Evolution
  Epochs with Integer Synodic Months Per Year"	Mark Popinchalk	Aucun	2023-03-30 20:36:39	"Humans like to party, and New Year celebrations are a great way to do that. However New Years celebrations that rely on an orbital year don't line up with those that use a Lunar Calendar, as there are currently 12.368 synodic months (moonths) in a year. There is cyclostratigraphic, paleontological, and tidal rhythmite data that reveal that over billions of years the interplay of angular momentum between the Sun, Earth and Moon has changed the rate of rotation of Earth, and at the same time evolved the orbit of the Moon, and therefore the length of a Lunar month. Using a subset of this data and referencing literature models of the Moon's orbital evolution, we create our own simple model to determine ""True Happy New Years"", time periods when there were an integer number of lunar synodic months in an Earth orbital year. This would allow modern calendars to pick a shared New Year's Day, and party accordingly. We then predict the next True Happy New Year to be in 252 million years, and offer suggestions to begin the party planning process early, so that we as a planet may be ready."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17697v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Do We Price Happiness? Evidence from Korean Stock Market	HyeonJun Kim	Aucun	2023-08-19 14:55:49	This study explores the potential of internet search volume data, specifically Google Trends, as an indicator for cross-sectional stock returns. Unlike previous studies, our research specifically investigates the search volume of the topic 'happiness' and its impact on stock returns in the aspect of risk pricing rather than as sentiment measurement. Empirical results indicate that this 'happiness' search exposure (HSE) can explain future returns, particularly for big and value firms. This suggests that HSE might be a reflection of a firm's ability to produce goods or services that meet societal utility needs. Our findings have significant implications for institutional investors seeking to leverage HSE-based strategies for outperformance. Additionally, our research suggests that, when selected judiciously, some search topics on Google Trends can be related to risks that impact stock prices.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10039v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Happy-GLL: modular, reusable and complete top-down parsers for
  parameterized nonterminals"	L. Thomas van Binsbergen	Damian Frolich	2023-03-14 16:23:23	Parser generators and parser combinator libraries are the most popular tools for producing parsers. Parser combinators use the host language to provide reusable components in the form of higher-order functions with parsers as parameters. Very few parser generators support this kind of reuse through abstraction and even fewer generate parsers that are as modular and reusable as the parts of the grammar for which they are produced. This paper presents a strategy for generating modular, reusable and complete top-down parsers from syntax descriptions with parameterized nonterminals, based on the FUN-GLL variant of the GLL algorithm.   The strategy is discussed and demonstrated as a novel back-end for the Happy parser generator. Happy grammars can contain `parameterized nonterminals' in which parameters abstract over grammar symbols, granting an abstraction mechanism to define reusable grammar operators. However, the existing Happy back-ends do not deliver on the full potential of parameterized nonterminals as parameterized nonterminals cannot be reused across grammars. Moreover, the parser generation process may fail to terminate or may result in exponentially large parsers generated in an exponential amount of time.   The GLL back-end presented in this paper implements parameterized nonterminals successfully by generating higher-order functions that resemble parser combinators, inheriting all the advantages of top-down parsing. The back-end is capable of generating parsers for the full class of context-free grammars, generates parsers in linear time and generates parsers that find all derivations of the input string. To our knowledge, the presented GLL back-end makes Happy the first parser generator that combines all these features.   This paper describes the translation procedure of the GLL back-end and compares it to the LALR and GLR back-ends of Happy in several experiments.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08044v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Twitter reciprocal reply networks exhibit assortativity with respect to
  happiness"	Catherine A. Bliss	Isabel M. Kloumann, Kameron Decker Harris, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds	2011-12-05 17:27:09	The advent of social media has provided an extraordinary, if imperfect, 'big data' window into the form and evolution of social networks. Based on nearly 40 million message pairs posted to Twitter between September 2008 and February 2009, we construct and examine the revealed social network structure and dynamics over the time scales of days, weeks, and months. At the level of user behavior, we employ our recently developed hedonometric analysis methods to investigate patterns of sentiment expression. We find users' average happiness scores to be positively and significantly correlated with those of users one, two, and three links away. We strengthen our analysis by proposing and using a null model to test the effect of network topology on the assortativity of happiness. We also find evidence that more well connected users write happier status updates, with a transition occurring around Dunbar's number. More generally, our work provides evidence of a social sub-network structure within Twitter and raises several methodological points of interest with regard to social network reconstructions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1010v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Happy software developers solve problems better: psychological
  measurements in empirical software engineering"	Daniel Graziotin	Xiaofeng Wang, Pekka Abrahamsson	2015-05-05 08:54:44	For more than 30 years, it has been claimed that a way to improve software developers' productivity and software quality is to focus on people and to provide incentives to make developers satisfied and happy. This claim has rarely been verified in software engineering research, which faces an additional challenge in comparison to more traditional engineering fields: software development is an intellectual activity and is dominated by often-neglected human aspects. Among the skills required for software development, developers must possess high analytical problem-solving skills and creativity for the software construction process. According to psychology research, affects-emotions and moods-deeply influence the cognitive processing abilities and performance of workers, including creativity and analytical problem solving. Nonetheless, little research has investigated the correlation between the affective states, creativity, and analytical problem-solving performance of programmers. This article echoes the call to employ psychological measurements in software engineering research. We report a study with 42 participants to investigate the relationship between the affective states, creativity, and analytical problem-solving skills of software developers. The results offer support for the claim that happy developers are indeed better problem solvers in terms of their analytical abilities. The following contributions are made by this study: (1) providing a better understanding of the impact of affective states on the creativity and analytical problem-solving capacities of developers, (2) introducing and validating psychological measurements, theories, and concepts of affective states, creativity, and analytical-problem-solving skills in empirical software engineering, and (3) raising the need for studying the human factors of software engineering by employing a multidisciplinary viewpoint.	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.289	cs	arxiv					0.0	
HAPPY: Hybrid Address-based Page Policy in DRAMs	Mohsen Ghasempour	Aamer Jaleel, Jim Garside, Mikel Luján	2015-09-12 13:03:04	Memory controllers have used static page closure policies to decide whether a row should be left open, open-page policy, or closed immediately, close-page policy, after the row has been accessed. The appropriate choice for a particular access can reduce the average memory latency. However, since application access patterns change at run time, static page policies cannot guarantee to deliver optimum execution time. Hybrid page policies have been investigated as a means of covering these dynamic scenarios and are now implemented in state-of-the-art processors. Hybrid page policies switch between open-page and close-page policies while the application is running, by monitoring the access pattern of row hits/conflicts and predicting future behavior. Unfortunately, as the size of DRAM memory increases, fine-grain tracking and analysis of memory access patterns does not remain practical. We propose a compact memory address-based encoding technique which can improve or maintain the performance of DRAMs page closure predictors while reducing the hardware overhead in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. As a case study, we integrate our technique, HAPPY, with a state-of-the-art monitor, the Intel-adaptive open-page policy predictor employed by the Intel Xeon X5650, and a traditional Hybrid page policy. We evaluate them across 70 memory intensive workload mixes consisting of single-thread and multi-thread applications. The experimental results show that using the HAPPY encoding applied to the Intel-adaptive page closure policy can reduce the hardware overhead by 5X for the evaluated 64 GB memory (up to 40X for a 512 GB memory) while maintaining the prediction accuracy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03740v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"CruzAffect at AffCon 2019 Shared Task: A feature-rich approach to
  characterize happiness"	Jiaqi Wu	Ryan Compton, Geetanjali Rakshit, Marilyn Walker, Pranav Anand, Steve Whittaker	2019-02-16 01:54:47	We present our system, CruzAffect, for the CL-Aff Shared Task 2019. CruzAffect consists of several types of robust and efficient models for affective classification tasks. We utilize both traditional classifiers, such as XGBoosted Forest, as well as a deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifier. We explore rich feature sets such as syntactic features, emotional features, and profile features, and utilize several sentiment lexicons, to discover essential indicators of social involvement and control that a subject might exercise in their happy moments, as described in textual snippets from the HappyDB database. The data comes with a labeled set (10K), and a larger unlabeled set (70K). We therefore use supervised methods on the 10K dataset, and a bootstrapped semi-supervised approach for the 70K. We evaluate these models for binary classification of agency and social labels (Task 1), as well as multi-class prediction for concepts labels (Task 2). We obtain promising results on the held-out data, suggesting that the proposed feature sets effectively represent the data for affective classification tasks. We also build concepts models that discover general themes recurring in happy moments. Our results indicate that generic characteristics are shared between the classes of agency, social and concepts, suggesting it should be possible to build general models for affective classification tasks.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06024v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Identifying Emotion from Natural Walking	Liqing Cui	Shun Li, Wan Zhang, Zhan Zhang, Tingshao Zhu	2015-08-03 13:48:46	Emotion identification from gait aims to automatically determine persons affective state, it has attracted a great deal of interests and offered immense potential value in action tendency, health care, psychological detection and human-computer(robot) interaction.In this paper, we propose a new method of identifying emotion from natural walking, and analyze the relevance between the traits of walking and affective states. After obtaining the pure acceleration data of wrist and ankle, we set a moving average filter window with different sizes w, then extract 114 features including time-domain, frequency-domain, power and distribution features from each data slice, and run principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimension. In experiments, we train SVM, Decision Tree, multilayerperception, Random Tree and Random Forest classification models, and compare the classification accuracy on data of wrist and ankle with respect to different w. The performance of emotion identification on acceleration data of ankle is better than wrist.Comparing different classification models' results, SVM has best accuracy of identifying anger and happy could achieve 90:31% and 89:76% respectively, and identification ratio of anger-happy is 87:10%.The anger-neutral-happy classification reaches 85%-78%-78%.The results show that it is capable of identifying personal emotional states through the gait of walking.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00413v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The econometrics of happiness: Are we underestimating the returns to
  education and income?"	Christopher P Barrington-Leigh	Aucun	2018-07-31 14:20:49	"This paper describes a fundamental and empirically conspicuous problem that is inherent to all surveys of human feelings and opinions in which subjective responses are elicited on numerical scales. The paper also proposes a solution. The problem is ""focal value response"" (FVR) behavior, a deep tendency by some kinds of individuals -- particularly those with low levels of education -- to simplify the response scale by considering only a subset of possible responses such as the lowest, middle, and highest. This renders even the weak ordinality assumption used with such data invalid. I show in this paper that, especially if a researcher is trying to estimate the influence of education, the resulting biases in inference can be overwhelmingly large. Using the application of ""happiness"" or life satisfaction data as an example, I first use a multinomial logit model to diagnose the factors empirically associated with FVR. I then introduce a new computational approach to estimate the bias resulting from FVR, to correct estimates of univariate and multivariate inference, and to estimate an index quantifying the fraction of respondents who exhibit FVR. Addressing this problem resolves a longstanding and unexplained anomaly in the life satisfaction literature, namely that the returns to education, after adjusting for income, appear to be small or negative. I also show that, due to the same econometric problem, the marginal utility of income in a subjective wellbeing sense has been consistently underestimated by economists of happiness."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11835v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Ecosystem Path to General AI	Claes Strannegård	Niklas Engsner, Pietro Ferrari, Hans Glimmerfors, Marcus Hilding Södergren, Tobias Karlsson, Birger Kleve, Victor Skoglund	2021-08-17 12:00:57	We start by discussing the link between ecosystem simulators and general AI. Then we present the open-source ecosystem simulator Ecotwin, which is based on the game engine Unity and operates on ecosystems containing inanimate objects like mountains and lakes, as well as organisms such as animals and plants. Animal cognition is modeled by integrating three separate networks: (i) a reflex network for hard-wired reflexes; (ii) a happiness network that maps sensory data such as oxygen, water, energy, and smells, to a scalar happiness value; and (iii) a policy network for selecting actions. The policy network is trained with reinforcement learning (RL), where the reward signal is defined as the happiness difference from one time step to the next. All organisms are capable of either sexual or asexual reproduction, and they die if they run out of critical resources. We report results from three studies with Ecotwin, in which natural phenomena emerge in the models without being hardwired. First, we study a terrestrial ecosystem with wolves, deer, and grass, in which a Lotka-Volterra style population dynamics emerges. Second, we study a marine ecosystem with phytoplankton, copepods, and krill, in which a diel vertical migration behavior emerges. Third, we study an ecosystem involving lethal dangers, in which certain agents that combine RL with reflexes outperform pure RL agents.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07578v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Sentiment and structure in word co-occurrence networks on Twitter	Mikaela Irene Fudolig	Thayer Alshaabi, Michael V. Arnold, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds	2021-10-01 18:00:02	We explore the relationship between context and happiness scores in political tweets using word co-occurrence networks, where nodes in the network are the words, and the weight of an edge is the number of tweets in the corpus for which the two connected words co-occur. In particular, we consider tweets with hashtags #imwithher and #crookedhillary, both relating to Hillary Clinton's presidential bid in 2016. We then analyze the network properties in conjunction with the word scores by comparing with null models to separate the effects of the network structure and the score distribution. Neutral words are found to be dominant and most words, regardless of polarity, tend to co-occur with neutral words. We do not observe any score homophily among positive and negative words. However, when we perform network backboning, community detection results in word groupings with meaningful narratives, and the happiness scores of the words in each group correspond to its respective theme. Thus, although we observe no clear relationship between happiness scores and co-occurrence at the node or edge level, a community-centric approach can isolate themes of competing sentiments in a corpus.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00446-2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Happiness Maximizing Sets under Group Fairness Constraints (Technical
  Report)"	Jiping Zheng	Yuan Ma, Wei Ma, Yanhao Wang, Xiaoyang Wang	2022-08-13 02:54:29	Finding a happiness maximizing set (HMS) from a database, i.e., selecting a small subset of tuples that preserves the best score with respect to any nonnegative linear utility function, is an important problem in multi-criteria decision-making. When an HMS is extracted from a set of individuals to assist data-driven algorithmic decisions such as hiring and admission, it is crucial to ensure that the HMS can fairly represent different groups of candidates without bias and discrimination. However, although the HMS problem was extensively studied in the database community, existing algorithms do not take group fairness into account and may provide solutions that under-represent some groups.   In this paper, we propose and investigate a fair variant of HMS (FairHMS) that not only maximizes the minimum happiness ratio but also guarantees that the number of tuples chosen from each group falls within predefined lower and upper bounds. Similar to the vanilla HMS problem, we show that FairHMS is NP-hard in three and higher dimensions. Therefore, we first propose an exact interval cover-based algorithm called IntCov for FairHMS on two-dimensional databases. Then, we propose a bicriteria approximation algorithm called BiGreedy for FairHMS on multi-dimensional databases by transforming it into a submodular maximization problem under a matroid constraint. We also design an adaptive sampling strategy to improve the practical efficiency of BiGreedy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the efficacy and efficiency of our proposal.	http://dx.doi.org/10.14778/3565816.3565830	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Power of Small Coalitions under Two-Tier Majority on Regular Graphs	Pavel Chebotarev	David Peleg	2022-10-07 08:59:41	In this paper, we study the following problem. Consider a setting where a proposal is offered to the vertices of a given network $G$, and the vertices must conduct a vote and decide whether to accept the proposal or reject it. Each vertex $v$ has its own valuation of the proposal; we say that $v$ is ``happy'' if its valuation is positive (i.e., it expects to gain from adopting the proposal) and ``sad'' if its valuation is negative. However, vertices do not base their vote merely on their own valuation. Rather, a vertex $v$ is a \emph{proponent} of the proposal if the majority of its neighbors are happy with it and an \emph{opponent} in the opposite case. At the end of the vote, the network collectively accepts the proposal whenever the majority of its vertices are proponents. We study this problem for regular graphs with loops. Specifically, we consider the class $\mathcal{G}_{n|d|h}$ of $d$-regular graphs of odd order $n$ with all $n$ loops and $h$ happy vertices. We are interested in establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for the class $\mathcal{G}_{n|d|h}$ to contain a labeled graph accepting the proposal, as well as conditions to contain a graph rejecting the proposal. We also discuss connections to the existing literature, including that on majority domination, and investigate the properties of the obtained conditions.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2023.07.011	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Stress and Adaptation: Applying Anna Karenina Principle in Deep Learning
  for Image Classification"	Nesma Mahmoud	Hanna Antson, Jaesik Choi, Osamu Shimmi, Kallol Roy	2023-02-22 13:53:20	Image classification with deep neural networks has reached state-of-art with high accuracy. This success is attributed to good internal representation features that bypasses the difficulties of the non-convex optimization problems. We have little understanding of these internal representations, let alone quantifying them. Recent research efforts have focused on alternative theories and explanations of the generalizability of these deep networks. We propose the alternative perturbation of deep models during their training induces changes that lead to transitions to different families. The result is an Anna Karenina Principle AKP for deep learning, in which less generalizable models unhappy families vary more in their representation than more generalizable models happy families paralleling Leo Tolstoy dictum that all happy families look alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Anna Karenina principle has been found in systems in a wide range: from the surface of endangered corals exposed to harsh weather to the lungs of patients suffering from fatal diseases of AIDs. In our paper, we have generated artificial perturbations to our model by hot-swapping the activation and loss functions during the training. In this paper, we build a model to classify cancer cells from non-cancer ones. We give theoretical proof that the internal representations of generalizable happy models are similar in the asymptotic limit. Our experiments verify similar representations of generalizable models.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11380v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"The Effect of Pets on Happiness: A Large-scale Multi-Factor Analysis
  using Social Multimedia"	Xuefeng Peng	Li-Kai Chi, Jiebo Luo	2018-03-24 15:07:16	From reducing stress and loneliness, to boosting productivity and overall well-being, pets are believed to play a significant role in people's daily lives. Many traditional studies have identified that frequent interactions with pets could make individuals become healthier and more optimistic, and ultimately enjoy a happier life. However, most of those studies are not only restricted in scale, but also may carry biases by using subjective self-reports, interviews, and questionnaires as the major approaches. In this paper, we leverage large-scale data collected from social media and the state-of-the-art deep learning technologies to study this phenomenon in depth and breadth. Our study includes four major steps: 1) collecting timeline posts from around 20,000 Instagram users, 2) using face detection and recognition on 2-million photos to infer users' demographics, relationship status, and whether having children, 3) analyzing a user's degree of happiness based on images and captions via smiling classification and textual sentiment analysis, 3) applying transfer learning techniques to retrain the final layer of the Inception v3 model for pet classification, and 4) analyzing the effects of pets on happiness in terms of multiple factors of user demographics. Our main results have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method with many new insights. We believe this method is also applicable to other domains as a scalable, efficient, and effective methodology for modeling and analyzing social behaviors and psychological well-being. In addition, to facilitate the research involving human faces, we also release our dataset of 700K analyzed faces.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03507v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"The Anna Karenina principle: A concept for the explanation of success in
  science"	Lutz Bornmann	Werner Marx	2011-04-05 10:48:21	"The first sentence of Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina is: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Here Tolstoy means that for a family to be happy, several key aspects must be given (such as good health of all family members, acceptable financial security, and mutual affection). If there is a deficiency in any one or more of these key aspects, the family will be unhappy. In this paper we introduce the Anna Karenina principle as a concept that can explain success in science. Here we will refer to three central areas in modern science in which scarce resources will most usually lead to failure: (1) peer review of research grant proposals and manuscripts (money and journal space as scarce resources), (2) citation of publications (reception as a scarce resource), and (3) new scientific discoveries (recognition as a scarce resource). If resources are scarce (journal space, funds, reception, and recognition), there can be success only when several key prerequisites for the allocation of the resources are fulfilled. If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the grant proposal, manuscript submission, the published paper, or the discovery will not be successful."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0807v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happiness and the Patterns of Life: A Study of Geolocated Tweets	Morgan R. Frank	Lewis Mitchell, Peter S. Dodds, Christopher M. Danforth	2013-04-04 09:59:27	The patterns of life exhibited by large populations have been described and modeled both as a basic science exercise and for a range of applied goals such as reducing automotive congestion, improving disaster response, and even predicting the location of individuals. However, these studies previously had limited access to conversation content, rendering changes in expression as a function of movement invisible. In addition, they typically use the communication between a mobile phone and its nearest antenna tower to infer position, limiting the spatial resolution of the data to the geographical region serviced by each cellphone tower. We use a collection of 37 million geolocated tweets to characterize the movement patterns of 180,000 individuals, taking advantage of several orders of magnitude of increased spatial accuracy relative to previous work. Employing the recently developed sentiment analysis instrument known as the 'hedonometer', we characterize changes in word usage as a function of movement, and find that expressed happiness increases logarithmically with distance from an individual's average location.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep02625	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Competitive Equilibrium Relaxations in General Auctions	Johannes C. Müller	Aucun	2013-07-10 16:48:17	The goal of an auction is to determine commodity prices such that all participants are perfectly happy. Such a solution is called a competitive equilibrium and does not exist in general. For this reason we are interested in solutions which are similar to a competitive equilibrium. The article introduces two relaxations of a competitive equilibrium for general auctions. Both relaxations determine one price per commodity by solving a difficult non-convex optimization problem. The first model is a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), which ensures that each participant is either perfectly happy or his bid is rejected. An exact algorithm and a heuristic are provided for this model. The second model is a relaxation of the first one and only ensures that no participant incurs a loss. In an optimal solution to the second model, no participant can be made better off without making another one worse off.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2852v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Augmented generalized happy functions	Breeanne Baker Swart	Kristen A. Beck, Susan Crook, Christina Eubanks-Turner, Helen G.

A positive integer $u$ is in a cycle of $S_{[c,b]}$ if, for some positive integer $k$, $S_{[c,b]}^k(u) = u$ and for positive integers $v$ and $w$, $v$ is $w$-attracted for $S_{[c,b]}$ if, for some non-negative integer $\ell$, $S_{[c,b]}^\ell(v) = w$. In this paper, we prove that for each $c\geq 0$ and $b \geq 2$, and for any $u$ in a cycle of $S_{[c,b]}$, (1) if $b$ is even, then there exist arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive $u$-attracted integers and (2) if $b$ is odd, then there exist arbitrarily long sequences of 2-consecutive $u$-attracted integers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0297v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Automatic Facial Expression Recognition Using Features of Salient Facial
  Patches"	S L Happy	Aurobinda Routray	2015-05-15 11:07:39	Extraction of discriminative features from salient facial patches plays a vital role in effective facial expression recognition. The accurate detection of facial landmarks improves the localization of the salient patches on face images. This paper proposes a novel framework for expression recognition by using appearance features of selected facial patches. A few prominent facial patches, depending on the position of facial landmarks, are extracted which are active during emotion elicitation. These active patches are further processed to obtain the salient patches which contain discriminative features for classification of each pair of expressions, thereby selecting different facial patches as salient for different pair of expression classes. One-against-one classification method is adopted using these features. In addition, an automated learning-free facial landmark detection technique has been proposed, which achieves similar performances as that of other state-of-art landmark detection methods, yet requires significantly less execution time. The proposed method is found to perform well consistently in different resolutions, hence, providing a solution for expression recognition in low resolution images. Experiments on CK+ and JAFFE facial expression databases show the effectiveness of the proposed system.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2386334	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Robust Facial Expression Classification Using Shape and Appearance
  Features"	S. L. Happy	Aurobinda Routray	2015-05-15 11:15:18	Facial expression recognition has many potential applications which has attracted the attention of researchers in the last decade. Feature extraction is one important step in expression analysis which contributes toward fast and accurate expression recognition. This paper represents an approach of combining the shape and appearance features to form a hybrid feature vector. We have extracted Pyramid of Histogram of Gradients (PHOG) as shape descriptors and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) as appearance features. The proposed framework involves a novel approach of extracting hybrid features from active facial patches. The active facial patches are located on the face regions which undergo a major change during different expressions. After detection of facial landmarks, the active patches are localized and hybrid features are calculated from these patches. The use of small parts of face instead of the whole face for extracting features reduces the computational cost and prevents the over-fitting of the features for classification. By using linear discriminant analysis, the dimensionality of the feature is reduced which is further classified by using the support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results on two publicly available databases show promising accuracy in recognizing all expression classes.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAPR.2015.7050661	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Video Database of Human Faces under Near Infra-Red Illumination for
  Human Computer Interaction Aplications"	S L Happy	Anirban Dasgupta, Anjith George, Aurobinda Routray	2015-05-15 13:24:14	Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is an evolving area of research for coherent communication between computers and human beings. Some of the important applications of HCI as reported in literature are face detection, face pose estimation, face tracking and eye gaze estimation. Development of algorithms for these applications is an active field of research. However, availability of standard database to validate such algorithms is insufficient. This paper discusses the creation of such a database created under Near Infra-Red (NIR) illumination. NIR illumination has gained its popularity for night mode applications since prolonged exposure to Infra-Red (IR) lighting may lead to many health issues. The database contains NIR videos of 60 subjects in different head orientations and with different facial expressions, facial occlusions and illumination variation. This new database can be a very valuable resource for development and evaluation of algorithms on face detection, eye detection, head tracking, eye gaze tracking etc. in NIR lighting.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IHCI.2012.6481868	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Automated Alertness and Emotion Detection for Empathic Feedback During
  E-Learning"	S L Happy	A. Dasgupta, P. Patnaik, A. Routray	2016-04-01 16:13:05	In the context of education technology, empathic interaction with the user and feedback by the learning system using multiple inputs such as video, voice and text inputs is an important area of research. In this paper, a nonintrusive, standalone model for intelligent assessment of alertness and emotional state as well as generation of appropriate feedback has been proposed. Using the non-intrusive visual cues, the system classifies emotion and alertness state of the user, and provides appropriate feedback according to the detected cognitive state using facial expressions, ocular parameters, postures, and gestures. Assessment of alertness level using ocular parameters such as PERCLOS and saccadic parameters, emotional state from facial expression analysis, and detection of both relevant cognitive and emotional states from upper body gestures and postures has been proposed. Integration of such a system in e-learning environment is expected to enhance students performance through interaction, feedback, and positive mood induction.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/T4E.2013.19	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Living on the Edge: A Toy Model for Holographic Reconstruction of
  Algebras with Centers"	William Donnelly	Ben Michel, Donald Marolf, Jason Wien	2016-11-17 20:11:43	We generalize the Pastawski-Yoshida-Harlow-Preskill (HaPPY) holographic quantum error-correcting code to provide a toy model for bulk gauge fields or linearized gravitons. The key new elements are the introduction of degrees of freedom on the links (edges) of the associated tensor network and their connection to further copies of the HaPPY code by an appropriate isometry. The result is a model in which boundary regions allow the reconstruction of bulk algebras with central elements living on the interior edges of the (greedy) entanglement wedge, and where these central elements can also be reconstructed from complementary boundary regions. In addition, the entropy of boundary regions receives both Ryu-Takayanagi-like contributions and further corrections that model the $\frac{\delta \text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term of Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena. Comparison with Yang-Mills theory then suggests that this $\frac{\delta \text{Area}}{4G_N}$ term can be reinterpreted as a part of the bulk entropy of gravitons under an appropriate extension of the physical bulk Hilbert space.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP04(2017)093	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"An Unsupervised Approach for Overlapping Cervical Cell Cytoplasm
  Segmentation"	Pranav Kumar	S L Happy, Swarnadip Chatterjee, Debdoot Sheet, Aurobinda Routray	2017-02-17 19:29:57	The poor contrast and the overlapping of cervical cell cytoplasm are the major issues in the accurate segmentation of cervical cell cytoplasm. This paper presents an automated unsupervised cytoplasm segmentation approach which can effectively find the cytoplasm boundaries in overlapping cells. The proposed approach first segments the cell clumps from the cervical smear image and detects the nuclei in each cell clump. A modified Otsu method with prior class probability is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the cell clumps. Using distance regularized level set evolution, the contour around each nucleus is evolved until it reaches the cytoplasm boundaries. Promising results were obtained by experimenting on ISBI 2015 challenge dataset.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IECBES.2016.7843424	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Spontaneous vs. Posed smiles - can we tell the difference?	Bappaditya Mandal	Nizar Ouarti	2016-05-23 14:21:30	Smile is an irrefutable expression that shows the physical state of the mind in both true and deceptive ways. Generally, it shows happy state of the mind, however, `smiles' can be deceptive, for example people can give a smile when they feel happy and sometimes they might also give a smile (in a different way) when they feel pity for others. This work aims to distinguish spontaneous (felt) smile expressions from posed (deliberate) smiles by extracting and analyzing both global (macro) motion of the face and subtle (micro) changes in the facial expression features through both tracking a series of facial fiducial markers as well as using dense optical flow. Specifically the eyes and lips features are captured and used for analysis. It aims to automatically classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07026v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Impact of Intervals on the Emotional Effect in Western Music	Cengiz Kaygusuz	Julian Zuluaga	2018-12-10 17:49:30	"Every art form ultimately aims to invoke an emotional response over the audience, and music is no different. While the precise perception of music is a highly subjective topic, there is an agreement in the ""feeling"" of a piece of music in broad terms. Based on this observation, in this study, we aimed to determine the emotional feeling associated with short passages of music; specifically by analyzing the melodic aspects. We have used the dataset put together by Eerola et. al. which is comprised of labeled short passages of film music. Our initial survey of the dataset indicated that other than ""happy"" and ""sad"" labels do not possess a melodic structure. We transcribed the main melody of the happy and sad tracks and used the intervals between the notes to classify them. Our experiments have shown that treating a melody as a bag-of-intervals do not possess any predictive power whatsoever, whereas counting intervals with respect to the key of the melody yielded a classifier with 85% accuracy."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04723v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Detecting Emotion Primitives from Speech and their use in discerning
  Categorical Emotions"	Vasudha Kowtha	Vikramjit Mitra, Chris Bartels, Erik Marchi, Sue Booker, William Caruso, Sachin Kajarekar, Devang Naik	2020-01-31 03:11:24	Emotion plays an essential role in human-to-human communication, enabling us to convey feelings such as happiness, frustration, and sincerity. While modern speech technologies rely heavily on speech recognition and natural language understanding for speech content understanding, the investigation of vocal expression is increasingly gaining attention. Key considerations for building robust emotion models include characterizing and improving the extent to which a model, given its training data distribution, is able to generalize to unseen data conditions. This work investigated a long-shot-term memory (LSTM) network and a time convolution - LSTM (TC-LSTM) to detect primitive emotion attributes such as valence, arousal, and dominance, from speech. It was observed that training with multiple datasets and using robust features improved the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for valence, by 30\% with respect to the baseline system. Additionally, this work investigated how emotion primitives can be used to detect categorical emotions such as happiness, disgust, contempt, anger, and surprise from neutral speech, and results indicated that arousal, followed by dominance was a better detector of such emotions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01323v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Which Facial Expressions Can Reveal Your Gender? A Study With 3D Faces	Baiqiang Xia	Aucun	2018-05-01 14:50:23	Human exhibit rich gender cues in both appearance and behavior. In computer vision domain, gender recognition from facial appearance have been extensively studied, while facial behavior based gender recognition studies remain rare. In this work, we first demonstrate that facial expressions influence the gender patterns presented in 3D face, and gender recognition performance increases when training and testing within the same expression. In further, we design experiments which directly extract the morphological changes resulted from facial expressions as features, for expression-based gender recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that gender can be recognized with considerable accuracy in Happy and Disgust expressions, while Surprise and Sad expressions do not convey much gender related information. This is the first work in the literature which investigates expression-based gender classification with 3D faces, and reveals the strength of gender patterns incorporated in different types of expressions, namely the Happy, the Disgust, the Surprise and the Sad expressions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00371v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Fixed Points of Augmented Generalized Happy Functions II: Oases and
  Mirages"	Breeanne Baker Swart	Susan Crook, Helen G. Grundman, Laura Hall-Seelig, May Mei, Laurie Zack	2019-08-06 14:59:31	An augmented generalized happy function $S_{[c,b]}$ maps a positive integer to the sum of the squares of its base $b$ digits plus $c$. For $b\geq 2$ and $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, a $k$-desert base $b$ is a set of $k$ consecutive non-negative integers $c$ for each of which $S_{[c,b]}$ has no fixed points. In this paper, we examine a complementary notion, a $k$-oasis base $b$, which we define to be a set of $k$ consecutive non-negative integers $c$ for each of which $S_{[c,b]}$ has a fixed point. In particular, after proving some basic properties of oases base $b$, we compute bounds on the lengths of oases base $b$ and compute the minimal examples of maximal length oases base $b$ for small values of $b$.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02194v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Survey of Texture Zeros with Light Dirac Neutrinos	Happy Borgohain	Debasish Borah	2020-07-13 08:53:38	We classify all possible texture zeros in light neutrino mass matrix in diagonal charged lepton basis by considering Dirac nature of light neutrinos. For Hermitian nature of neutrino mass matrix, the number of possible texture zeros remain same as Majorana texture zeros, but with less free parameters due to the absence of additional Majorana CP phases. Relaxing the Hermitian nature of neutrino mass matrix lead to many more possibilities and freedom due to additional CP phases, mixing angles not constrained by neutrino data. While we find that none of the texture zeros in Hermitian case are allowed, in non-Hermitian case some textures even with four zeros are allowed. While most of the one-zero, two-zero and three-zero textures in this case are allowed, four-zero textures are tightly constrained with only 6 allowed out of 126 possibilities. The allowed textures also give interesting correlations between light neutrino parameters with sharp distinctions between normal and inverted mass ordering. Many of these allowed textures also saturate the Planck 2018 upper bound on the sum of absolute neutrino masses.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6471/abde9b	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"How happy are my neighbours? Modelling spatial spillover effects of
  well-being"	Thanasis Ziogas	Dimitris Ballas, Sierdjan Koster, Arjen Edzes	2020-07-22 11:24:09	This article uses data of subjective Life Satisfaction aggregated to the community level in Canada and examines the spatial interdependencies and spatial spillovers of community happiness. A theoretical model of utility is presented. Using spatial econometric techniques, we find that the utility of community, proxied by subjective measures of life satisfaction, is affected both by the utility of neighbouring communities as well as by the latter's average household income and unemployment rate. Shared cultural traits and institutions may justify such spillovers. The results are robust to the different binary contiguity spatial weights matrices used and to the various econometric models. Clusters of both high-high and low-low in Life Satisfaction communities are also found based on the Moran's I test	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11580v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Social Roles and Emotions
  while Working from Home"	Sam Nolan	Shakila Khan Rumi, Christoph Anderson, Klaus David, Flora D. Salim	2020-07-24 05:17:01	In the opening months of 2020, COVID-19 changed the way for which people work, forcing more people to work from home. This research investigates the impact of COVID-19 on five researchers' work and private roles, happiness, and mobile and desktop activity patterns. Desktop and smartphone application usage were gathered before and during COVID-19. Individuals' roles and happiness were captured through experience sampling. Our analysis show that researchers tend to work more during COVID-19 resulting an imbalance of work and private roles. We also found that as working styles and patterns as well as individual behaviour changed, reported valence distribution was less varied in the later weeks of the pandemic when compared to the start. This shows a resilient adaptation to the disruption caused by the pandemic.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12353v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"An Effective Feature Selection Method Based on Pair-Wise Feature
  Proximity for High Dimensional Low Sample Size Data"	S L Happy	Ramanarayan Mohanty, Aurobinda Routray	2017-08-08 11:05:18	Feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. However, the efficacy of the selection criteria for low sample size applications is neglected in most cases. Most of the existing feature selection criteria are based on the sample similarity. However, the distance measures become insignificant for high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data. Moreover, the variance of a feature with a few samples is pointless unless it represents the data distribution efficiently. Instead of looking at the samples in groups, we evaluate their efficiency based on pairwise fashion. In our investigation, we noticed that considering a pair of samples at a time and selecting the features that bring them closer or put them far away is a better choice for feature selection. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with low sample size, which outperforms many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.	http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081474	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Online optimal task offloading with one-bit feedback	Shangshu Zhao	Zhaowei Zhu, Fuqian Yang, Xiliang Luo	2018-06-27 16:04:00	Task offloading is an emerging technology in fog-enabled networks. It allows users to transmit tasks to neighbor fog nodes so as to utilize the computing resources of the networks. In this paper, we investigate a stochastic task offloading model and propose a multi-armed bandit framework to formulate this model. We consider the fact that different helper nodes prefer different kinds of tasks. Further, we assume each helper node just feeds back one-bit information to the task node to indicate the level of happiness. The key challenge of this problem lies in the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We thus implement a UCB-type algorithm to maximize the long-term happiness metric. Numerical simulations are given in the end of the paper to corroborate our strategy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10547v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Tale of Santa Claus, Hypergraphs and Matroids	Sami Davies	Thomas Rothvoss, Yihao Zhang	2018-07-19 00:05:47	A well-known problem in scheduling and approximation algorithms is the Santa Claus problem. Suppose that Santa Claus has a set of gifts, and he wants to distribute them among a set of children so that the least happy child is made as happy as possible. Here, the value that a child $i$ has for a present $j$ is of the form $p_{ij} \in \{ 0,p_j\}$. A polynomial time algorithm by Annamalai et al. gives a $12.33$-approximation and is based on a modification of Haxell's hypergraph matching argument.   In this paper, we introduce a matroid version of the Santa Claus problem. Our algorithm is also based on Haxell's augmenting tree, but with the introduction of the matroid structure we solve a more general problem with cleaner methods. Our result can then be used as a blackbox to obtain a $(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Santa Claus. This factor also compares against a natural, compact LP for Santa Claus.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07189v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Studying the Impact of Mood on Identifying Smartphone Users	Khadija Zanna	Sayde King, Tempestt Neal, Shaun Canavan	2019-06-27 20:55:16	This paper explores the identification of smartphone users when certain samples collected while the subject felt happy, upset or stressed were absent or present. We employ data from 19 subjects using the StudentLife dataset, a dataset collected by researchers at Dartmouth College that was originally collected to correlate behaviors characterized by smartphone usage patterns with changes in stress and academic performance. Although many previous works on behavioral biometrics have implied that mood is a source of intra-person variation which may impact biometric performance, our results contradict this assumption. Our findings show that performance worsens when removing samples that were generated when subjects may be happy, upset, or stressed. Thus, there is no indication that mood negatively impacts performance. However, we do find that changes existing in smartphone usage patterns may correlate with mood, including changes in locking, audio, location, calling, homescreen, and e-mail habits. Thus, we show that while mood is a source of intra-person variation, it may be an inaccurate assumption that biometric systems (particularly, mobile biometrics) are likely influenced by mood.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11960v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Phenomenological study of texture zeros of neutrino mass matrix in
  minimal left-right symmetric model"	Happy Borgohain	Mrinal Kumar Das, Debasish Borah	2020-04-12 15:34:21	We studied the phenomenological implications of texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix of the minimal left-right symmetric model (LRSM). Since the possibility of maximum zeros reduces the maximum number of free parameters of the model making it more predictive, we considered only those cases with maximum possible texture zeros in light neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu}$, Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$ and heavy right-handed (RH) neutrino mass matrix $M_{RR}$. We then computed the correlations among the different light neutrino parameters and then the new physics contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD) for the different texture zero cases. We find that for RH neutrino masses above 1 GeV, the new physics contributions to NDBD can saturate the corresponding experimental bound.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1468/1/012191	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Hearing through Vibrations: Perception of Musical Emotions by Profoundly
  Deaf People"	Anastasia Schmitz	Catherine Holloway, Youngjun Cho	2020-12-24 14:14:42	Advances in tactile-audio feedback technology have created new possibilities for deaf people to feel music. However, little is known about deaf individuals' perception of musical emotions through vibrotactile feedback. In this paper, we present the findings from a mixed-methods study with 16 profoundly deaf participants. The study protocol was designed to explore how users of a backpack-style vibrotactile display perceive intended emotions in twenty music excerpts. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that participants correctly identified happy and angry excerpts and rated them as more arousing than sad and peaceful excerpts. More positive emotions were experienced during happy compared to angry excerpts while peaceful and sad excerpts were hard to be differentiated. Based on qualitative data, we highlight the benefits and limitations of using vibrations to convey musical emotions to profoundly deaf users. Finally, we provide guidelines for designing accessible music experiences for the deaf community.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13265v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Cutting-edge 3D Medical Image Segmentation Methods in 2020: Are Happy
  Families All Alike?"	Jun Ma	Aucun	2021-01-01 13:39:26	"Segmentation is one of the most important and popular tasks in medical image analysis, which plays a critical role in disease diagnosis, surgical planning, and prognosis evaluation. During the past five years, on the one hand, thousands of medical image segmentation methods have been proposed for various organs and lesions in different medical images, which become more and more challenging to fairly compare different methods. On the other hand, international segmentation challenges can provide a transparent platform to fairly evaluate and compare different methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the top methods in ten 3D medical image segmentation challenges during 2020, covering a variety of tasks and datasets. We also identify the ""happy-families"" practices in the cutting-edge segmentation methods, which are useful for developing powerful segmentation approaches. Finally, we discuss open research problems that should be addressed in the future. We also maintain a list of cutting-edge segmentation methods at \url{https://github.com/JunMa11/SOTA-MedSeg}."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00232v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Distantly Supervised Transformers For E-Commerce Product QA	Happy Mittal	Aniket Chakrabarti, Belhassen Bayar, Animesh Anant Sharma, Nikhil Rasiwasia	2021-04-07 06:37:16	We propose a practical instant question answering (QA) system on product pages of ecommerce services, where for each user query, relevant community question answer (CQA) pairs are retrieved. User queries and CQA pairs differ significantly in language characteristics making relevance learning difficult. Our proposed transformer-based model learns a robust relevance function by jointly learning unified syntactic and semantic representations without the need for human labeled data. This is achieved by distantly supervising our model by distilling from predictions of a syntactic matching system on user queries and simultaneously training with CQA pairs. Training with CQA pairs helps our model learning semantic QA relevance and distant supervision enables learning of syntactic features as well as the nuances of user querying language. Additionally, our model encodes queries and candidate responses independently allowing offline candidate embedding generation thereby minimizing the need for real-time transformer model execution. Consequently, our framework is able to scale to large e-commerce QA traffic. Extensive evaluation on user queries shows that our framework significantly outperforms both syntactic and semantic baselines in offline as well as large scale online A/B setups of a popular e-commerce service.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02947v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Online Max-min Fair Allocation	Yasushi Kawase	Hanna Sumita	2021-11-14 03:53:03	We study an online version of the max-min fair allocation problem for indivisible items. In this problem, items arrive one by one, and each item must be allocated irrevocably on arrival to one of $n$ agents, who have additive valuations for the items. Our goal is to make the least happy agent as happy as possible. In research on the topic of online allocation, this is a fundamental and natural problem. Our main result is to reveal the asymptotic competitive ratios of the problem for both the adversarial and i.i.d. input models. We design a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm that is asymptotically $1/n$-competitive for the adversarial model, and we show that this guarantee is optimal. To this end, we present a randomized algorithm with the same competitive ratio first and then derandomize it. A natural derandomization fails to achieve the competitive ratio of $1/n$. We instead build the algorithm by introducing a novel technique. When the items are drawn from an unknown identical and independent distribution, we construct a simple polynomial-time deterministic algorithm that outputs a nearly optimal allocation. We analyze the strict competitive ratio and show almost tight bounds for the solution. We further mention some implications of our results on variants of the problem.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07235v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A heuristic algorithm using tree decompositions for the maximum happy
  vertices problem"	Louis Carpentier	Jorik Jooken, Jan Goedgebeur	2022-08-31 15:25:43	We propose a new methodology to develop heuristic algorithms using tree decompositions. Traditionally, such algorithms construct an optimal solution of the given problem instance through a dynamic programming approach. We modify this procedure by introducing a parameter $W$ that dictates the number of dynamic programming states to consider. We drop the exactness guarantee in favour of a shorter running time. However, if $W$ is large enough such that all valid states are considered, our heuristic algorithm proves optimality of the constructed solution. In particular, we implement a heuristic algorithm for the Maximum Happy Vertices problem using this approach. Our algorithm more efficiently constructs optimal solutions compared to the exact algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. Furthermore, our algorithm constructs higher quality solutions than state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms Greedy-MHV and Growth-MHV for instances of which at least 40\% of the vertices are initially coloured, at the cost of a larger running time.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14921v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Effect of Spreading Knowledge Centers -- A Physics-based Approach	Saurish Chakrabarty	Aucun	2023-02-28 19:18:45	"We use a simple physics-inspired model to get an idea about how to enhance the speed with which a society becomes educated if we strategically place our knowledge spreading centers (teachers or educational institutions). We study knowledge spreading using the Ising model, a well-studied model used in physics, specifically statistical mechanics, to describe the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. In the social context, up and down spins are mapped to knowledgeable and ignorant individuals. We introduce some knowledgeable individuals into an otherwise ignorant society and see how their number increases with time, when evolved using the Metropolis algorithm. We find that the knowledge of the society grows faster when the initial group of knowledgeable individuals is maximally spread out. We quantify this effect using the doubling time and look at the distribution of the doubling time as a function of ""temperature"". In the social context, the energy is identified as the (lack of) happiness of neighbours and temperature is a parameter that quantifies how important happiness is in the society. We point out several limitations of this study in order to facilitate future research."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00036v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
BBCA-LEDGER: High Throughput Consensus meets Low Latency	Chrysoula Stathakopoulou	Michael Wei, Maofan Yin, Hongbo Zhang, Dahlia Malkhi	2023-06-26 15:11:50	This paper presents BBCA-LEDGER, a Byzantine log replication technology for partially synchronous networks enabling blocks to be broadcast in parallel, such that each broadcast is finalized independently and instantaneously into an individual slot in the log. Every finalized broadcast is eventually committed to the total ordering, so that all network bandwidth has utility in disseminating blocks. Finalizing log slots in parallel achieves both high throughput and low latency. BBCA-LEDGER is composed of two principal protocols that interweave together, a low-latency/high-throughput happy path, and a high-throughput DAG-based fallback path. The happy path employs a novel primitive called BBCA, a consistent broadcast enforcing unique slot numbering. In steady state, BBCA ensures that a transaction can be committed with low latency, in just 3 network steps. Under network partitions or faults, we harness recent advances in BFT and build a fallback mechanism on a direct acyclic graph (DAG) created by BBCA broadcasts. In this manner, BBCA-LEDGER exhibits the throughput benefits of DAG-based BFT in face of gaps.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14757v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Mood Classification of Bangla Songs Based on Lyrics	Maliha Mahajebin	Mohammad Rifat Ahmmad Rashid, Nafees Mansoor	2023-07-19 03:31:41	Music can evoke various emotions, and with the advancement of technology, it has become more accessible to people. Bangla music, which portrays different human emotions, lacks sufficient research. The authors of this article aim to analyze Bangla songs and classify their moods based on the lyrics. To achieve this, this research has compiled a dataset of 4000 Bangla song lyrics, genres, and used Natural Language Processing and the Bert Algorithm to analyze the data. Among the 4000 songs, 1513 songs are represented for the sad mood, 1362 for the romantic mood, 886 for happiness, and the rest 239 are classified as relaxation. By embedding the lyrics of the songs, the authors have classified the songs into four moods: Happy, Sad, Romantic, and Relaxed. This research is crucial as it enables a multi-class classification of songs' moods, making the music more relatable to people's emotions. The article presents the automated result of the four moods accurately derived from the song lyrics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10314v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The psychometric house-of-mirrors: the effect of measurement distortions
  on agent-based models' predictions"	Dino Carpentras	Michael Quayle	2023-12-08 15:30:40	Agent-based models (ABMs) often rely on psychometric constructs such as 'opinions', 'stubbornness', 'happiness', etc. The measurement process for these constructs is quite different from the one used in physics as there is no standardized unit of measurement for opinion or happiness. Consequently, measurements are usually affected by 'psychometric distortions,' which can substantially impact models' predictions. Even if distortions are well known in psychometrics, their existence and nature is obscure to many researchers outside this field. In this paper, we introduce distortions to the ABM community. Initially, we show where distortions come from and how to observe them in real-world data. We then show how they can strongly impact predictions, qualitative comparison with data and the problem they pose for validation of models. We conclude our analysis by discussing how researchers may mitigate this problem and highlight possible future modelling trends that will address this problem.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2022.2137938	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Amygdala and cortical gamma band responses to emotional faces depend on
  the attended to valence"	Enya M. Weidner	Stephan Moratti, Sebastian Schindler, Philip Grewe, Christian G. Bien, Johanna Kissler	2023-04-12 08:42:32	The amygdala is assumed to contribute to a bottom-up attentional bias during visual processing of emotional faces. Still, how its response to emotion interacts with top-down attention is not fully understood. It is also unclear if amygdala activity and scalp EEG respond to emotion and attention in a similar way. Therefore, we studied the interaction of emotion and attention during face processing in oscillatory gamma-band activity (GBA) in the amygdala and on the scalp. Amygdala signals were recorded via intracranial EEG (iEEG) in 10 patients with epilepsy. Scalp recordings were collected from 19 healthy participants. Three randomized blocks of angry, neutral, and happy faces were presented, and either negative, neutral, or positive expressions were denoted as targets. Both groups detected happy faces fastest and most accurately. During attention to negative faces, low GBA (< 90 Hz) increased specifically for angry faces both in the amygdala and over posterior scalp regions, albeit earlier on the scalp (60 ms) than in the amygdala (130 ms). From 220 ms, amygdala high GBA (117.5-145 Hz) was additionally persistently increased for both angry and neutral compared to happy faces. When neutral faces served as targets, amygdala high GBA (105-122.5 Hz) was higher for emotional than neutral faces from 160-320 ms. Attention to positive faces did not result in a differentiation between facial expressions. Present data reveal that attention-independent emotion detection in amygdala high GBA may only occur during a neutral focus of attention. Top-down threat vigilance coordinates widespread GBA, biasing stimulus processing in favor of negative faces. These results are in line with a multi-pathway model of emotion processing and help specify the role of GBA in this process by revealing how attentional focus can tune timing and amplitude of emotional GBA responses.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05700v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Flexive and Propulsive Dynamics of Elastica at Low Reynolds Numbers	Chris H. Wiggins	Raymond E.

Considering this happy consequence and the principles of elasticity, we study a hyperdiffusion equation for the shape of the elastica in viscous flow, find solutions for impulsive or oscillatory forcing, and elucidate relevant aspects of propulsion. These results have application in a variety of physical and biological contexts, from dynamic biopolymer bending experiments to instabilities of elastic filaments.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3879	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Excellence in Computer Simulation	Leo P. Kadanoff	Aucun	2003-07-13 21:15:42	Excellent computer simulations are done for a purpose. The most valid purposes are to explore uncharted territory, to resolve a well-posed scientific or technical question, or to make a design choice. Stand-alone modeling can serve the first purpose. The other two goals need a full integration of the modeling effort into a scientific or engineering program.   Some excellent work, much of it related to the Department of Energy Laboratories, is reviewed. Some less happy stories are recounted.   In the past, some of the most impressive work has involved complexity and chaos. Prediction in a complex world requires a first principles understanding based upon the intersection of theory, experiment and simulation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0307033v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Happy endings for flip graphs	David Eppstein	Aucun	2006-10-15 01:30:48	We show that the triangulations of a finite point set form a flip graph that can be embedded isometrically into a hypercube, if and only if the point set has no empty convex pentagon. Point sets of this type include convex subsets of lattices, points on two lines, and several other infinite families. As a consequence, flip distance in such point sets can be computed efficiently.	http://dx.doi.org/10.20382/jocg.v1i1a2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Ramseyan ultrafilters	Lorenz Halbeisen	Aucun	2001-09-16 20:08:02	We investigate families of partitions of omega which are related to special coideals, so-called happy families, and give a dual form of Ramsey ultrafilters in terms of partitions. The combinatorial properties of these partition-ultrafilters, which we call Ramseyan ultrafilters, are similar to those of Ramsey ultrafilters. For example it will be shown that dual Mathias forcing restricted to a Ramseyan ultrafilter has the same features as Mathias forcing restricted to a Ramsey ultrafilter. Further we introduce an ordering on the set of partition-filters and consider the dual form of some cardinal characteristics of the continuum.	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0109102v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On consecutive happy numbers	Hao Pan	Aucun	2006-07-08 02:47:17	Let e>=1 and b>=2 be integers.

In this paper, we prove that there exist arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive (e,b)-happy numbers provided that e-1 is not divisible by p-1 for any prime divisor p of b-1.	http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607213v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

Link projections and flypes	Cam Van Quach Hongler	Claude Weber	2009-06-11 09:24:54	Let \Pi be a link projection in S^2. John Conway and later Francis Bonahon and Larry Siebenmann undertook to split $\Pi$ into canonical pieces. These pieces received different names: basic or polyhedral diagrams on one hand, rational, algebraic, bretzel, arborescent diagrams on the other hand. This paper proposes a thorough presentation of the theory, known to happy fews. We apply the existence and uniqueness theorem for the canonical decomposition to the classification of Haseman circles and to the localisation of the flypes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2059v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Information Theory of Emotions of Musical Chords	Vadim R. Madgazin	Aucun	2009-09-22 12:24:19	The paper offers a solution to the centuries-old puzzle - why the major chords are perceived as happy and the minor chords as sad - based on the information theory of emotions. A theory and a formula of musical emotions were created. They define the sign and the amplitude of the utilitarian emotional coloration of separate major and minor chords through relative pitches of constituent sounds. Keywords: chord, major, minor, the formula of musical emotions, the information theory of emotions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3976v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Albert Einstein's close friends and colleagues from the Patent Office	Galina Weinstein	Aucun	2012-05-17 10:54:38	"In the Patent Office Einstein hatched his most beautiful ideas, and there he spent his ""Happy Bern Years"". These wonderful ideas led to his miraculous year works of 1905. Einstein was not an expert in academic matters, and he was out of academic world. Neither did he meet influential professors, or attend academic meetings. He discussed his ideas with his close friends and colleagues from the Patent Office. In 1907 he finally got his foot into the academic doorway; Einstein became a privatdozent and gave lectures at the University of Bern. However, his first students consisted again of his two close friends and another colleague from the Patent Office."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3904v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Core stability in hedonic coalition formation	Gerhard J. Woeginger	Aucun	2012-12-10 22:23:19	In many economic, social and political situations individuals carry out activities in groups (coalitions) rather than alone and on their own. Examples range from households and sport clubs to research networks, political parties and trade unions. The underlying game theoretic framework is known as coalition formation.   This survey discusses the notion of core stability in hedonic coalition formation (where each player's happiness only depends on the other members of his coalition but not on how the remaining players outside his coalition are grouped). We present the central concepts and algorithmic approaches in the area, provide many examples, and pose a number of open problems.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2236v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"How to Be Both Rich and Happy: Combining Quantitative and Qualitative
  Strategic Reasoning about Multi-Player Games (Extended Abstract)"	Nils Bulling	Valentin Goranko	2013-03-04 19:06:01	We propose a logical framework combining a game-theoretic study of abilities of agents to achieve quantitative objectives in multi-player games by optimizing payoffs or preferences on outcomes with a logical analysis of the abilities of players for achieving qualitative objectives of players, i.e., reaching or maintaining game states with desired properties. We enrich concurrent game models with payoffs for the normal form games associated with the states of the model and propose a quantitative extension of the logic ATL* enabling the combination of quantitative and qualitative reasoning.	http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.112.8	cs	arxiv					0.0

In this project, music recommendation system built upon on a naive Bayes classifier, trained to predict the sentiment of songs based on song lyrics alone. The experimental results show that music corresponding to a happy mood can be detected with high precision based on text features obtained from song lyrics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00138v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models	Ismail Shahin	Aucun	2017-06-29 13:04:50	The importance of speaking style authentication from human speech is gaining an increasing attention and concern from the engineering community. The importance comes from the demand to enhance both the naturalness and efficiency of spoken language human-machine interface. Our work in this research focuses on proposing, implementing, and testing speaker-dependent and text-dependent speaking style authentication (verification) systems that accept or reject the identity claim of a speaking style based on suprasegmental hidden Markov models (SPHMMs). Based on using SPHMMs, our results show that the average speaking style authentication performance is: 99%, 37%, 85%, 60%, 61%, 59%, 41%, 61%, and 57% belonging respectively to the speaking styles: neutral, shouted, slow, loud, soft, fast, angry, happy, and fearful.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09736v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Speaker Identification Investigation and Analysis in Unbiased and Biased
  Emotional Talking Environments"	Ismail Shahin	Aucun	2017-06-29 13:45:09	This work aims at investigating and analyzing speaker identification in each unbiased and biased emotional talking environments based on a classifier called Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs). The first talking environment is unbiased towards any emotion, while the second talking environment is biased towards different emotions. Each of these talking environments is made up of six distinct emotions. These emotions are neutral, angry, sad, happy, disgust and fear. The investigation and analysis of this work show that speaker identification performance in the biased talking environment is superior to that in the unbiased talking environment. The obtained results in this work are close to those achieved in subjective assessment by human judges.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10772-012-9156-2	cs	arxiv					0.0

Heavy Tails Make Happy Buyers	Eric Bax	Aucun	2020-02-20 20:47:42	In a second-price auction with i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) bidder valuations, adding bidders increases expected buyer surplus if the distribution of valuations has a sufficiently heavy right tail. While this does not imply that a bidder in an auction should prefer for more bidders to join the auction, it does imply that a bidder should prefer it in exchange for the bidder being allowed to participate in more auctions. Also, for a heavy-tailed valuation distribution, marginal expected seller revenue per added bidder remains strong even when there are already many bidders.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09014v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Speech features that are commonly used in speech emotion recognition rely on global utterance level prosodic features. In our work, we evaluate the impact of frame level feature extraction. The speech samples are from Berlin emotional database and the features extracted from these utterances are energy, different variant of mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, velocity and acceleration features.	http://dx.doi.org/10.5815/ijigsp.2013.09.02	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happy family of stable marriages	Gershon Wolansky	Aucun	2018-05-17 10:33:04	Some aspects of the problem of stable marriage are discussed. There are two distinguished marriage plans: the fully transferable case, where money can be transferred between the participants, and the fully non transferable case where each participant has its own rigid preference list regarding the other gender. We continue to discuss intermediate partial transferable cases. Partial transferable plans can be approached as either special cases of cooperative games using the notion of a core, or as a generalization of the cyclical monotonicity property of the fully transferable case (fake promises). We shall introduced these two approaches, and prove the existence of stable marriage for the fully transferable and non-transferable plans.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06687v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

An author's dexterity in the use of these emotions captivates readers and makes it difficult for them to put the book down. In this paper, we model the flow of emotions over a book using recurrent neural networks and quantify its usefulness in predicting success in books. We obtained the best weighted F1-score of 69% for predicting books' success in a multitask setting (simultaneously predicting success and genre of books).	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09746v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

The task objective is to classify emotion (i.e. happy, sad, angry) in a 3-turn conversational data set. We formulate the task as a classification problem and introduce a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) model with attention layer, which is bootstrapped with contextual information and trained with a multigenre corpus. We utilize different word embeddings to empirically select the most suited one to represent our features. We train the model with a multigenre emotion corpus to leverage using all available training sets to bootstrap the results. We achieved overall %56.05 f1-score and placed 144.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09439v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Does ICSE Accept the Right Contributions?	Lutz Prechelt	Aucun	2019-11-25 11:42:44	Background: There is a constant discussion regarding whether the ICSE Technical Research track is accepting too many contributions of some type and too few of some other type.   Questions: Are ICSE and the contributions it is seeing well aligned with what is important for bringing software engineering forward?   Method: 26 expert interviews with senior members of the ICSE community, evaluated qualitatively and reported with many quotations.   Results: About three quarters of the respondents are not generally happy with ICSE's alignment. Two specific complaints that recur frequently concern a) many low-relevance contributions making it into the program and b) several types of high-relevance contributions hardly seen in the ICSE program.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11541v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Euclidean Supergravity and Multi-Centered Solutions	W. A. Sabra	Aucun	2016-12-31 14:44:01	In ungauged supergravity theories, the no-force condition for BPS states implies the existence of stable static multi-centered solutions. The first solutions to Einstein-Maxwell theory with a positive cosmological constant describing an arbitrary number of charged black holes were found by Kastor and Traschen. Generalisations to five and higher dimensional theories were obtained by London. Multi-centered solutions in gauged supergravity, even with time-dependence allowed, have yet to be constructed. In this letter we construct supersymmetry-preserving multi-centered solutions for the case of D=5, N=2 Euclidean gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. Higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell multi-centered solutions are also presented.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2017.01.067	cs	arxiv					0.0

In this paper, we present a first approach to emotion classification using persistent entropy and support vector machines. A topology-based model is applied to obtain a single real number from each raw signal. These data are used as input of a support vector machine to classify signals into 8 different emotions (calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust and surprised).	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10828-1_8	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Some more twisted Hilbert spaces	Daniel Morales	Jesús Suárez	2020-12-11 15:09:04	"We provide three new examples of twisted Hilbert spaces by considering properties that are ""close"" to Hilbert. We denote them $Z(\mathcal J)$, $Z(\mathcal S^2)$ and $Z(\mathcal T_s^2)$. The first space is asymptotically Hilbertian but not weak Hilbert. On the opposite side, $Z(\mathcal S^2)$ and $Z(\mathcal T_s^2)$ are not asymptotically Hilbertian. Moreover, the space $Z(\mathcal T_s^2)$ is a HAPpy space and the technique to prove it gives a ""twisted"" version of a theorem of Johnson and Szankowski (Ann. of Math. 176:1987--2001, 2012). This is, we can construct a nontrivial twisted Hilbert space such that the isomorphism constant from its $n$-dimensional subspaces to $\ell_2^n$ grows to infinity as slowly as we wish when $n\to \infty$."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06411v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Gaussian Happy Numbers	Breeanne Baker Swart	Susan Crook, Helen G.

We investigate the fixed points and cycles of the Gaussian $B$-happy functions, determining them for small values of $B$ and providing a method for computing them for any $B \geq 2$. We discuss heights of Gaussian $B$-happy numbers, proving results concerning the smallest Gaussian $B$-happy numbers of certain heights. Finally, we prove conditions for the existence and non-existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic sequences of Gaussian $B$-happy numbers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00560v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

In the first survey, respondents were asked about their household income and subjective well-being. Based on the data collected, three different respondents' income positions within the residential locality, within a group of the same educational background, and cohort were obtained. In the follow-up survey for the treatment group, respondents are informed of their income positions and then asked for subjective well-being. Key findings are that, after obtaining information, a higher individual's income position improves their subjective well-being. The effects varied according to individual characteristics and proxies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11185v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Polite Emotional Dialogue Acts for Conversational Analysis in Daily
  Dialog Data"	Chandrakant Bothe	Aucun	2021-12-27 08:48:57	Many socio-linguistic cues are used in the conversational analysis, such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue acts. One of the fundamental social cues is politeness, which linguistically possesses properties useful in conversational analysis. This short article presents some of the brief findings of polite emotional dialogue acts, where we can correlate the relational bonds between these socio-linguistics cues. We found that the utterances with emotion classes Anger and Disgust are more likely to be impolite while Happiness and Sadness to be polite. Similar phenomenon occurs with dialogue acts, Inform and Commissive contain many polite utterances than Question and Directive. Finally, we will conclude on the future work of these findings.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13572v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On the angular momentum of compact binary coalescence	Xiaokai He	Xiaoning Wu, Naqing Xie	2022-01-30 14:12:10	The supertranslation ambiguity issue of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity. Recently, there appeared the first definition of angular momentum at null infinity that is supertranslation invariant. However, in the compact binary coalescence community, supertranslation ambiguity is often ignored. This paper demonstrates that we have the happy circumstance that the newly defined angular momentum coincides with the classical definition at the quadrupole level.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1572-9494/acb7cf	cs	arxiv					0.0

Finding Emotions in Faces: A Meta-Classifier	Siddartha Dalal	Sierra Vo, Michael Lesk, Wesley Yuan	2022-08-20 13:11:18	Machine learning has been used to recognize emotions in faces, typically by looking for 8 different emotional states (neutral, happy, sad, surprise, fear, disgust, anger and contempt). We consider two approaches: feature recognition based on facial landmarks and deep learning on all pixels; each produced 58% overall accuracy. However, they produced different results on different images and thus we propose a new meta-classifier combining these approaches.

Emotion Conditioned Creative Dialog Generation	Khalid Alnajjar	Mika Hämäläinen	2022-12-06 12:05:43	We present a DialGPT based model for generating creative dialog responses that are conditioned based on one of the following emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pain, sadness and surprise. Our model is capable of producing a contextually apt response given an input sentence and a desired emotion label. Our model is capable of expressing the desired emotion with an accuracy of 0.6. The best performing emotions are neutral, fear and disgust. When measuring the strength of the expressed emotion, we find that anger, fear and disgust are expressed in the most strong fashion by the model.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02907v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Computer says ""No"": The Case Against Empathetic Conversational AI"	Alba Curry	Amanda Cercas Curry	2022-12-21 12:36:17	"Emotions are an integral part of human cognition and they guide not only our understanding of the world but also our actions within it. As such, whether we soothe or flame an emotion is not inconsequential. Recent work in conversational AI has focused on responding empathetically to users, validating and soothing their emotions without a real basis. This AI-aided emotional regulation can have negative consequences for users and society, tending towards a one-noted happiness defined as only the absence of ""negative"" emotions. We argue that we must carefully consider whether and how to respond to users' emotions."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10983v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

Recent p+p measurements of the wide-angle, early-time jet splittings show consistency with theoretical calculations while subsequent later-time splittings hint at deviations from the theory. We study splittings along a jet tree in vacuum representing the perturbative QCD, transition, and non-perturbative QCD regions. With a specially selected resolved splitting, we highlight its apparent disagreement with pQCD predictions and discuss its features.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11846v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Swampland Revisited	Michel Cass\e'	Joseph Silk	2023-01-03 19:00:01	The transcendental expectation of string theory is that the nature of the fundamental forces, particle spectra and masses, together with coupling constants, is uniquely determined by mathematical and logical consistency, non-empirically, that is by pure reason. However pluralism triumphed with the explosive emergence of the multiverse. String theorists have extended a long-sought dream (their unique and final theory) to a landscape or a happy caparnaum. Proponents of string theory try to qualify their arguments via swampland conjectures while cosmologists retreat to their telescopes. We review the current status of the string theory swampland.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03464v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"CrowDC: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Paired Comparisons in
  Crowdsourcing"	Ming-Hung Wang	Chia-Yuan Zhang, Jia-Ru Song	2023-02-23 00:59:35	Ranking a set of samples based on subjectivity, such as the experience quality of streaming video or the happiness of images, has been a typical crowdsourcing task. Numerous studies have employed paired comparison analysis to solve challenges since it reduces the workload for participants by allowing them to select a single solution. Nonetheless, to thoroughly compare all target combinations, the number of tasks increases quadratically. This paper presents ``CrowDC'', a divide-and-conquer algorithm for paired comparisons. Simulation results show that when ranking more than 100 items, CrowDC can reduce 40-50% in the number of tasks while maintaining 90-95% accuracy compared to the baseline approach.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11722v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happy or Evil Laughter? Analysing a Database of Natural Audio Samples	Aljoscha Düsterhöft	Felix Burkhardt, Björn W.

The selection criterion was to be present a communicative act with clear connotation of being either positive (laughing with) or negative (being laughed at). On the basis of this annotated data, we performed two experiments: on the one hand, we manually extract and analyze phonetic features. On the other hand, we conduct several machine learning experiments by systematically combining several automatically extracted acoustic feature sets with machine learning algorithms. This shows that the best performing models can achieve and unweighted average recall of .7.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14023v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

  Approach"	Nikunj Bajaj	Aurobinda Routray, S L Happy	2013-11-23 15:40:37	Emotions are best way of communicating information; and sometimes it carry more information than words. Recently, there has been a huge interest in automatic recognition of human emotion because of its wide spread application in security, surveillance, marketing, advertisement, and human-computer interaction. To communicate with a computer in a natural way, it will be desirable to use more natural modes of human communication based on voice, gestures and facial expressions. In this paper, a holistic approach for facial expression recognition is proposed which captures the variation in facial features in temporal domain and classifies the sequence of images in different emotions. The proposed method uses Haar-like features to detect face in an image. The dimensionality of the eigenspace is reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By projecting the subsequent face images into principal eigen directions, the variation pattern of the obtained weight vector is modeled to classify it into different emotions. Owing to the variations of expressions for different people and its intensity, a person specific method for emotion recognition is followed. Using the gray scale images of the frontal face, the system is able to classify four basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6007v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Climate change sentiment on Twitter: An unsolicited public opinion poll	Emily M. Cody	Andrew J. Reagan, Lewis Mitchell, Peter Sheridan Dodds, Christopher M. Danforth	2015-05-14 17:25:13	"The consequences of anthropogenic climate change are extensively debated through scientific papers, newspaper articles, and blogs. Newspaper articles may lack accuracy, while the severity of findings in scientific papers may be too opaque for the public to understand. Social media, however, is a forum where individuals of diverse backgrounds can share their thoughts and opinions. As consumption shifts from old media to new, Twitter has become a valuable resource for analyzing current events and headline news. In this research, we analyze tweets containing the word ""climate"" collected between September 2008 and July 2014. Through use of a previously developed sentiment measurement tool called the Hedonometer, we determine how collective sentiment varies in response to climate change news, events, and natural disasters. We find that natural disasters, climate bills, and oil-drilling can contribute to a decrease in happiness while climate rallies, a book release, and a green ideas contest can contribute to an increase in happiness. Words uncovered by our analysis suggest that responses to climate change news are predominately from climate change activists rather than climate change deniers, indicating that Twitter is a valuable resource for the spread of climate change awareness."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136092	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Indian Spontaneous Expression Database for Emotion Recognition	S L Happy	Priyadarshi Patnaik, Aurobinda Routray, Rajlakshmi Guha	2015-12-03 02:51:08	Automatic recognition of spontaneous facial expressions is a major challenge in the field of affective computing. Head rotation, face pose, illumination variation, occlusion etc. are the attributes that increase the complexity of recognition of spontaneous expressions in practical applications. Effective recognition of expressions depends significantly on the quality of the database used. Most well-known facial expression databases consist of posed expressions. However, currently there is a huge demand for spontaneous expression databases for the pragmatic implementation of the facial expression recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose and establish a new facial expression database containing spontaneous expressions of both male and female participants of Indian origin. The database consists of 428 segmented video clips of the spontaneous facial expressions of 50 participants. In our experiment, emotions were induced among the participants by using emotional videos and simultaneously their self-ratings were collected for each experienced emotion. Facial expression clips were annotated carefully by four trained decoders, which were further validated by the nature of stimuli used and self-report of emotions. An extensive analysis was carried out on the database using several machine learning algorithms and the results are provided for future reference. Such a spontaneous database will help in the development and validation of algorithms for recognition of spontaneous expressions.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2498174	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"An Empirical Analysis of the Role of Amplifiers, Downtoners, and
  Negations in Emotion Classification in Microblogs"	Florian Strohm	Roman Klinger	2018-08-31 09:55:06	"The effect of amplifiers, downtoners, and negations has been studied in general and particularly in the context of sentiment analysis. However, there is only limited work which aims at transferring the results and methods to discrete classes of emotions, e. g., joy, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, and disgust. For instance, it is not straight-forward to interpret which emotion the phrase ""not happy"" expresses. With this paper, we aim at obtaining a better understanding of such modifiers in the context of emotion-bearing words and their impact on document-level emotion classification, namely, microposts on Twitter. We select an appropriate scope detection method for modifiers of emotion words, incorporate it in a document-level emotion classification model as additional bag of words and show that this approach improves the performance of emotion classification. In addition, we build a term weighting approach based on the different modifiers into a lexical model for the analysis of the semantics of modifiers and their impact on emotion meaning. We show that amplifiers separate emotions expressed with an emotion- bearing word more clearly from other secondary connotations. Downtoners have the opposite effect. In addition, we discuss the meaning of negations of emotion-bearing words. For instance we show empirically that ""not happy"" is closer to sadness than to anger and that fear-expressing words in the scope of downtoners often express surprise."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DSAA.2018.00087	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Human Extraction and Scene Transition utilizing Mask R-CNN	Asati Minkesh	Kraittipong Worranitta, Miyachi Taizo	2019-07-20 23:57:46	Object detection is a trendy branch of computer vision, especially on human recognition and pedestrian detection. Recognizing the complete body of a person has always been a difficult problem. Over the years, researchers proposed various methods, and recently, Mask R-CNN has made a breakthrough for instance segmentation. Based on Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN has been able to generate a segmentation mask for each instance. We propose an application to extracts multiple persons from images and videos for pleasant life scenes to grouping happy moments of people such as family or friends and a community for QOL (Quality Of Life). We likewise propose a methodology to put extracted images of persons into the new background. This enables a user to make a pleasant collection of happy facial expressions and actions of his/her family and friends in his/her life. Mask R-CNN detects all types of object masks from images. Then our algorithm considers only the target person and extracts a person only without obstacles, such as dogs in front of the person, and the user also can select multiple persons as their expectations. Our algorithm is effective for both an image and a video irrespective of the length of it. Our algorithm does not add any overhead to Mask R-CNN, running at 5 fps. We show examples of yoga-person in an image and a dancer in a dance-video frame. We hope our simple and effective approach would serve as a baseline for replacing the image background and help ease future research.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08884v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Happiness is assortative in online social networks	Johan Bollen	Bruno Goncalves, Guangchen Ruan, Huina Mao	2011-03-03 21:05:17	"Social networks tend to disproportionally favor connections between individuals with either similar or dissimilar characteristics. This propensity, referred to as assortative mixing or homophily, is expressed as the correlation between attribute values of nearest neighbour vertices in a graph. Recent results indicate that beyond demographic features such as age, sex and race, even psychological states such as ""loneliness"" can be assortative in a social network. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that general happiness or Subjective Well-Being (SWB) of Twitter users, as measured from a 6 month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. To our knowledge this is the first result that shows assortative mixing in online networks at the level of SWB. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important instrument in better understanding how both positive and negative sentiments spread through online social ties. Future research may focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user behavior in ""real life""."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/artl_a_00034	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Science Driven Innovations Powering Mobile Product: Cloud AI vs. Device
  AI Solutions on Smart Device"	Deguang Kong	Aucun	2017-11-20 23:42:34	Recent years have witnessed the increasing popularity of mobile devices (such as iphone) due to the convenience that it brings to human lives. On one hand, rich user profiling and behavior data (including per-app level, app-interaction level and system-interaction level) from heterogeneous information sources make it possible to provide much better services (such as recommendation, advertisement targeting) to customers, which further drives revenue from understanding users' behaviors and improving user' engagement. In order to delight the customers, intelligent personal assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Google Now) are highly desirable to provide real-time audio, video and image recognition, natural language understanding, comfortable user interaction interface, satisfactory recommendation and effective advertisement targeting.   This paper presents the research efforts we have conducted on mobile devices which aim to provide much smarter and more convenient services by leveraging statistics and big data science, machine learning and deep learning, user modeling and marketing techniques to bring in significant user growth and user engagement and satisfactions (and happiness) on mobile devices. The developed new features are built at either cloud side or device side, harmonically working together to enhance the current service with the purpose of increasing users' happiness. We illustrate how we design these new features from system and algorithm perspective using different case studies, through which one can easily understand how science driven innovations help to provide much better service in technology and bring more revenue liftup in business. In the meantime, these research efforts have clear scientific contributions and published in top venues, which are playing more and more important roles for mobile AI products.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07580v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Extracting human emotions at different places based on facial
  expressions and spatial clustering analysis"	Yuhao Kang	Qingyuan Jia, Song Gao, Xiaohuan Zeng, Yueyao Wang, Stephan Angsuesser, Yu Liu, Xinyue Ye, Teng Fei	2019-05-06 04:10:37	The emergence of big data enables us to evaluate the various human emotions at places from a statistic perspective by applying affective computing. In this study, a novel framework for extracting human emotions from large-scale georeferenced photos at different places is proposed. After the construction of places based on spatial clustering of user generated footprints collected in social media websites, online cognitive services are utilized to extract human emotions from facial expressions using the state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. And two happiness metrics are defined for measuring the human emotions at different places. To validate the feasibility of the framework, we take 80 tourist attractions around the world as an example and a happiness ranking list of places is generated based on human emotions calculated over 2 million faces detected out from over 6 million photos. Different kinds of geographical contexts are taken into consideration to find out the relationship between human emotions and environmental factors. Results show that much of the emotional variation at different places can be explained by a few factors such as openness. The research may offer insights on integrating human emotions to enrich the understanding of sense of place in geography and in place-based GIS.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12552	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"AI in Pursuit of Happiness, Finding Only Sadness: Multi-Modal Facial
  Emotion Recognition Challenge"	Carl Norman	Aucun	2019-10-24 14:49:39	The importance of automated Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) grows the more common human-machine interactions become, which will only continue to increase dramatically with time. A common method to describe human sentiment or feeling is the categorical model the `7 basic emotions', consisting of `Angry', `Disgust', `Fear', `Happiness', `Sadness', `Surprise' and `Neutral'. The `Emotion Recognition in the Wild' (EmotiW) competition is now in its 7th year and has become the standard benchmark for measuring FER performance. The focus of this paper is the EmotiW sub-challenge of classifying videos in the `Acted Facial Expression in the Wild' (AFEW) dataset, consisting of both visual and audio modalities, into one of the above classes. Machine learning has exploded as a research topic in recent years, with advancements in `Deep Learning' a key part of this. Although Deep Learning techniques have been widely applied to the FER task by entrants in previous years, this paper has two main contributions: (i) to apply the latest `state-of-the-art' visual and temporal networks and (ii) exploring various methods of fusing features extracted from the visual and audio elements to enrich the information available to the final model making the prediction. There are a number of complex issues that arise when trying to classify emotions for `in-the-wild' video sequences, which the above two approaches attempt to directly address. There are some positive findings when comparing the results of this paper to past submissions, indicating that further research into the proposed methods and fine-tuning of the models deployed, could result in another step forwards in the field of automated FER.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05187v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Emotion-Recognition Using Smart Watch Sensor Data: Mixed-Design Study	Juan C. Quiroz	Elena Geangu, Min Hooi Yong	2018-06-22 07:00:14	"This study investigates the use of movement sensor data from a smart watch to infer an individual's emotional state. We present our findings on a user study with 50 participants. The experimental design is a mixed-design study; within-subjects (emotions; happy, sad, neutral) and between-subjects (stimulus type: audio-visual ""movie clips"", audio ""music clips""). Each participant experienced both emotions in a single stimulus type. All participants walked 250m while wearing a smart watch on one wrist and a heart rate monitor strap on their chest. They also had to answer a short questionnaire (20 items; PANAS) before and after experiencing each emotion. The heart rate monitor served as supplementary information to our data. We performed time-series analysis on the data from the smart watch and a t-test on the questionnaire items to measure the change in emotional state. The heart rate data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. We extracted features from the time-series using sliding windows and used the features to train and validate classifiers that determined an individual's emotion. Participants reported feeling less negative affect after watching sad videos or after listening to the sad music, P < .006. For the task of emotion recognition using classifiers, our results show that the personal models outperformed personal baselines, and achieved median accuracies higher than 78% for all conditions of the design study for the binary classification of happiness vs sadness. Our findings show that we are able to detect the changes in emotional state with data obtained from the smartwatch as well as behavioral responses."	http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/10153	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Domain Aware Markov Logic Networks	Happy Mittal	Ayush Bhardwaj, Vibhav Gogate, Parag Singla	2018-07-03 11:00:24	Combining logic and probability has been a long stand- ing goal of AI research. Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) achieve this by attaching weights to formulas in first-order logic, and can be seen as templates for constructing features for ground Markov networks. Most techniques for learning weights of MLNs are domain-size agnostic, i.e., the size of the domain is not explicitly taken into account while learn- ing the parameters of the model. This often results in ex- treme probabilities when testing on domain sizes different from those seen during training. In this paper, we propose Domain Aware Markov logic Networks (DA-MLNs) which present a principled solution to this problem. While defin- ing the ground network distribution, DA-MLNs divide the ground feature weight by a scaling factor which is a function of the number of connections the ground atoms appearing in the feature are involved in. We show that standard MLNs fall out as a special case of our formalism when this func- tion evaluates to a constant equal to 1. Experiments on the benchmark Friends & Smokers domain show that our ap- proach results in significantly higher accuracies compared to existing methods when testing on domains whose sizes different from those seen during training.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01082v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum Mona Lisa Cat	Rashid Ahmad	Sumaira Nawaz	2020-01-28 05:56:48	"Schr\""{o}dinger's Cat was proposed by Erwin Schr\""{o}dinger, the infamous thought experiment in which a cat in a box was both alive and dead simultaneously illustrating a quantum phenomenon known as superposition. In 2013, Yakir Aharonov and his co-authors conceived of an experiment suggesting that a particle can be separated from its property. They called the effect a ""Quantum Cheshire Cat"" that has been experimentally verified in the succeeding year. The name Quantum Cheshire Cat is inspired from a fanciful character of the Cheshire Cat in ""\textit{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland""} a novel written by Lewis Carroll where the grin of cat is found without a cat. An important question arises here. Once the grin of the Cheshire Cat is separated, is there any correlation still left between the grin and the cat? To answer the question we propose a thought experiment in which Quantum Cheshire Cat is also a Schr\""{o}dinger's Cat existing in superposition of happy(smiling) and sad(frowning) states. We name this cat as a ""Quantum Mona Lisa Cat"" for the reason that historically it is presumed that Mona Lisa's portrait contains both characteristics of happy(smiling) and sad(frowning) and either is observed depending upon the mood of the observer. We show that property separated from particle behave as ""Quantum Mona Lisa Cat""."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10184v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Does Subjective Well-being Contribute to Our Understanding of Mexican
  Well-being?"	Jeremy Heald	Erick Treviño Aguilar	2020-04-23 18:46:05	The article reviews the history of well-being to gauge how subjective question surveys can improve our understanding of well-being in Mexico. The research uses data at the level of the 32 federal entities or States, taking advantage of the heterogeneity in development indicator readings between and within geographical areas, the product of socioeconomic inequality. The data come principally from two innovative subjective questionnaires, BIARE and ENVIPE, which intersect in their fully representative state-wide applications in 2014, but also from conventional objective indicator sources such as the HDI and conventional surveys. This study uses two approaches, a descriptive analysis of a state-by-state landscape of indicators, both subjective and objective, in an initial search for stand-out well-being patterns, and an econometric study of a large selection of mainly subjective indicators inspired by theory and the findings of previous Mexican research. Descriptive analysis confirms that subjective well-being correlates strongly with and complements objective data, providing interesting directions for analysis. The econometrics literature indicates that happiness increases with income and satisfying of material needs as theory suggests, but also that Mexicans are relatively happy considering their mediocre incomes and high levels of insecurity, the last of which, by categorizing according to satisfaction with life, can be shown to impact poorer people disproportionately. The article suggests that well-being is a complex, multidimensional construct which can be revealed by using exploratory multi-regression and partial correlations models which juxtapose subjective and objective indicators.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11420v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A note on the network coloring game: A randomized distributed $(Δ
  +1)$-coloring algorithm"	Nikolaos Fryganiotis	Symeon Papavassiliou, Christos Pelekis	2021-06-01 11:28:13	The network coloring game has been proposed in the literature of social sciences as a model for conflict-resolution circumstances. The players of the game are the vertices of a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$. The game is played over rounds, and in each round all players simultaneously choose a color from a set of available colors. Players have local information of the graph: they only observe the colors chosen by their neighbors and do not communicate or cooperate with one another. A player is happy when she has chosen a color that is different from the colors chosen by her neighbors, otherwise she is unhappy, and a configuration of colors for which all players are happy is a proper coloring of the graph. It has been shown in the literature that, when the players adopt a particular greedy randomized strategy, the game reaches a proper coloring of the graph within $O(\log(n))$ rounds, with high probability, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least $\Delta+2$. In this note we show that a modification of the aforementioned greedy strategy yields likewise a proper coloring of the graph, provided the number of colors available to each player is at least $\Delta+1$, and results in a simple randomized distributed algorithm for the $(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem..	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00402v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Jolteon and Ditto: Network-Adaptive Efficient Consensus with
  Asynchronous Fallback"	Rati Gelashvili	Lefteris Kokoris-Kogias, Alberto Sonnino, Alexander Spiegelman, Zhuolun Xiang	2021-06-18 21:34:17	Existing committee-based Byzantine state machine replication (SMR) protocols, typically deployed in production blockchains, face a clear trade-off: (1) they either achieve linear communication cost in the happy path, but sacrifice liveness during periods of asynchrony, or (2) they are robust (progress with probability one) but pay quadratic communication cost. We believe this trade-off is unwarranted since existing linear protocols still have asymptotic quadratic cost in the worst case. We design Ditto, a Byzantine SMR protocol that enjoys the best of both worlds: optimal communication on and off the happy path (linear and quadratic, respectively) and progress guarantee under asynchrony and DDoS attacks. We achieve this by replacing the view-synchronization of partially synchronous protocols with an asynchronous fallback mechanism at no extra asymptotic cost. Specifically, we start from HotStuff, a state-of-the-art linear protocol, and gradually build Ditto. As a separate contribution and an intermediate step, we design a 2-chain version of HotStuff, Jolteon, which leverages a quadratic view-change mechanism to reduce the latency of the standard 3-chain HotStuff. We implement and experimentally evaluate all our systems. Notably, Jolteon's commit latency outperforms HotStuff by 200-300ms with varying system size. Additionally, Ditto adapts to the network and provides better performance than Jolteon under faulty conditions and better performance than VABA (a state-of-the-art asynchronous protocol) under faultless conditions. This proves our case that breaking the robustness-efficiency trade-off is in the realm of practicality.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10362v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The peak-and-end rule and differential equations with maxima: a view on
  the unpredictability of happiness"	Elena Trofimchuk	Eduardo Liz, Sergei Trofimchuk	2021-06-21 04:08:12	"In the 1990s, after a series of experiments, the behavioral psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues formulated the following Peak-End evaluation rule: ""The remembered utility of pleasant or unpleasant episodes is accurately predicted by averaging the Peak (most intense value) of instant utility (or disutility) recorded during an episode and the instant utility recorded near the end of the experience"", (D. Kahneman et al., 1997, QJE, p. 381). Hence, the simplest mathematical model for time evolution of the experienced utility function $u=u(t)$ can be given by the scalar differential equation $u'(t)=a u(t) + b \max \{u(s) : s\in [t-h,t]\}+f(t) \ (*),$ where $f$ represents exogenous stimuli, $h$ is the maximal duration of the experience, and $a, b \in \mathbb R$ are some averaging weights. In this work, we study equation $(*)$ and show that, for a range of parameters $a, b, h$ and a periodic sine-like term $f$, the dynamics of $(*)$ can be completely described in terms of an associated one-dimensional dynamical system generated by a piece-wise continuous map from a finite interval into itself. We illustrate our approach with two examples. In particular, we show that the hedonic utility $u(t)$ (`happiness') can exhibit chaotic behavior."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6544/aca50d	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Embedding-based Music Emotion Recognition Using Composite Loss	Naoki Takashima	Frédéric Li, Marcin Grzegorzek, Kimiaki Shirahama	2021-12-14 06:54:08	Most music emotion recognition approaches perform classification or regression that estimates a general emotional category from a distribution of music samples, but without considering emotional variations (e.g., happiness can be further categorised into much, moderate or little happiness). We propose an embedding-based music emotion recognition approach that associates music samples with emotions in a common embedding space by considering both general emotional categories and fine-grained discrimination within each category. Since the association of music samples with emotions is uncertain due to subjective human perceptions, we compute composite loss-based embeddings obtained to maximise two statistical characteristics, one being the correlation between music samples and emotions based on canonical correlation analysis, and the other being a probabilistic similarity between a music sample and an emotion with KL-divergence. The experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our embedding-based approach, the composite loss and learned acoustic features. In addition, detailed analysis shows that our approach can accomplish robust bidirectional music emotion recognition that not only identifies music samples matching with a specific emotion but also detects emotions expressed in a certain music sample.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07192v5	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Active Source Free Domain Adaptation	Fan Wang	Zhongyi Han, Zhiyan Zhang, Yilong Yin	2022-05-22 02:33:51	Source free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer a trained source model to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. However, the SFDA setting faces an effect bottleneck due to the absence of source data and target supervised information, as evidenced by the limited performance gains of newest SFDA methods. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a more practical scenario called active source free domain adaptation (ASFDA) that permits actively selecting a few target data to be labeled by experts. To achieve that, we first find that those satisfying the properties of neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and target-like are the best points to select, and we define them as the minimum happy (MH) points. We then propose minimum happy points learning (MHPL) to actively explore and exploit MH points. We design three unique strategies: neighbor ambient uncertainty, neighbor diversity relaxation, and one-shot querying, to explore the MH points. Further, to fully exploit MH points in the learning process, we design a neighbor focal loss that assigns the weighted neighbor purity to the cross-entropy loss of MH points to make the model focus more on them. Extensive experiments verify that MHPL remarkably exceeds the various types of baselines and achieves significant performance gains at a small cost of labeling.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10711v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Impact of Partner Expressions on Felt Emotion in the Iterated
  Prisoner's Dilemma: An Event-level Analysis"	Maria Angelika-Nikita	Celso M. de Melo, Kazunori Terada, Gale Lucas, Jonathan Gratch	2022-07-03 00:30:46	Social games like the prisoner's dilemma are often used to develop models of the role of emotion in social decision-making. Here we examine an understudied aspect of emotion in such games: how an individual's feelings are shaped by their partner's expressions. Prior research has tended to focus on other aspects of emotion. Research on felt-emotion has focused on how an individual's feelings shape how they treat their partner, or whether these feelings are authentically expressed. Research on expressed-emotion has focused on how an individual's decisions are shaped by their partner's expressions, without regard for whether these expressions actually evoke feelings. Here, we use computer-generated characters to examine how an individual's moment-to-moment feelings are shaped by (1) how they are treated by their partner and (2) what their partner expresses during this treatment. Surprisingly, we find that partner expressions are far more important than actions in determining self-reported feelings. In other words, our partner can behave in a selfish and exploitive way, but if they show a collaborative pattern of expressions, we will feel greater pleasure collaborating with them. These results also emphasize the importance of context in determining how someone will feel in response to an expression (i.e., knowing a partner is happy is insufficient; we must know what they are happy-at). We discuss the implications of this work for cognitive-system design, emotion theory, and methodological practice in affective computing.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00925v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On the Evolution of (Hateful) Memes by Means of Multimodal Contrastive
  Learning"	Yiting Qu	Xinlei He, Shannon Pierson, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Savvas Zannettou	2022-12-13 13:38:04	The dissemination of hateful memes online has adverse effects on social media platforms and the real world. Detecting hateful memes is challenging, one of the reasons being the evolutionary nature of memes; new hateful memes can emerge by fusing hateful connotations with other cultural ideas or symbols. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages multimodal contrastive learning models, in particular OpenAI's CLIP, to identify targets of hateful content and systematically investigate the evolution of hateful memes. We find that semantic regularities exist in CLIP-generated embeddings that describe semantic relationships within the same modality (images) or across modalities (images and text). Leveraging this property, we study how hateful memes are created by combining visual elements from multiple images or fusing textual information with a hateful image. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework for analyzing the evolution of hateful memes by focusing on antisemitic memes, particularly the Happy Merchant meme. Using our framework on a dataset extracted from 4chan, we find 3.3K variants of the Happy Merchant meme, with some linked to specific countries, persons, or organizations. We envision that our framework can be used to aid human moderators by flagging new variants of hateful memes so that moderators can manually verify them and mitigate the problem of hateful content online.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06573v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"GANalyzer: Analysis and Manipulation of GANs Latent Space for
  Controllable Face Synthesis"	Ali Pourramezan Fard	Mohammad H. Mahoor, Sarah Ariel Lamer, Timothy Sweeny	2023-02-02 06:55:40	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of synthesizing high-quality facial images. Despite their success, GANs do not provide any information about the relationship between the input vectors and the generated images. Currently, facial GANs are trained on imbalanced datasets, which generate less diverse images. For example, more than 77% of 100K images that we randomly synthesized using the StyleGAN3 are classified as Happy, and only around 3% are Angry. The problem even becomes worse when a mixture of facial attributes is desired: less than 1% of the generated samples are Angry Woman, and only around 2% are Happy Black. To address these problems, this paper proposes a framework, called GANalyzer, for the analysis, and manipulation of the latent space of well-trained GANs. GANalyzer consists of a set of transformation functions designed to manipulate latent vectors for a specific facial attribute such as facial Expression, Age, Gender, and Race. We analyze facial attribute entanglement in the latent space of GANs and apply the proposed transformation for editing the disentangled facial attributes. Our experimental results demonstrate the strength of GANalyzer in editing facial attributes and generating any desired faces. We also create and release a balanced photo-realistic human face dataset.

"Should I be reporting ""happy ending"" spas to the board?"	Liveie	Aucun	2022-07-09 01:59:22	I live in PA, and I wasn't sure if I was mandated to report this nature to the board/police. I've heard that the police haven't gotten them yet, but I know the board can fine them.  What do you ask think? It's kind of a moral/ethical dilemma as well.   Edit: my next question would be, how? Where do I report it? I thought the board required it to be reported to them but I can't find anything.	https://www.reddit.com/r/massage/comments/vuqugn/should_i_be_reporting_happy_ending_spas_to_the/		reddit	vuqugn	massage	26.0	26.0	64.0	US
What are the signs for a “happy ending” massage?	katiebakes94	Aucun	2021-10-11 22:43:43	So I went and had a massage recently. The town I live in has a lot of those Asian massage places and I’ve been to a bunch of them. They’re all pretty much the same experience but I had a massage on the weekend and this one was… iffy.   Flag 1: cash only. They did not accept credit/debit cards.   Flag 2: the windows were completely covered up.   Flag 3: they only had a towel on the bed for me to get under. Not a sheet   Flag 4:  I took my bra off but I like to keep my undies on. The “masseuse” pulled my panties wayyy down under my butt cheeks. And didn’t cover me up with the towel.   Flag 5: the massage was more of a rub down. The guy seemed like he’d never given a massage before. It was jerky and weird.   Flag 6: the masseuse straddled my butt to massage my back.   Flag 7: while massaging my lower back, his finger went down my butt crack. I tensed my cheeks so he couldn’t go too far.   Flag 8: when I rolled over he attempted to massage my breasts. And I had to hold the towel so I didn’t get exposed.   Flag 9: tried to massage my groin. I said no and then he asked to massage my stomach. I said he could massage my neck instead.   Writing it out I’m inclined to think something odd was going on but… maybe he was just really new?   Oh and the oil went cold at one point 😩	https://www.reddit.com/r/massage/comments/q67tt3/what_are_the_signs_for_a_happy_ending_massage/		reddit	q67tt3	massage	27.0	27.0	12.0	General Question
I (23M) got a ‘Happy Ending massage’ nine months ago and I’m STILL crippled by shame and guilt	davechoeisgod	Aucun	2019-02-26 17:08:45	About eight and a half months ago I went to get a Thai massage.   I did my research and headed off to what I thought was a legitimate, above-board establishment (good reviews from both men and women, landline, premises on a main road etc.)  I paid for the treatment and was taken into a room.  About an hour into the 90-minute appointment the massage therapist touched my dick and balls over the towel that was covering me and began to make a hand gesture over the towel. She then took the towel off (I was completely naked) and she began to jerk me off.   I didn’t stop her and it felt good at the time. But I never thought this would be a possibility because I hadn’t expressly gone out to get this type of ‘service’.   I obviously ejaculated and she got some toilet paper/tissues to clean. I got dressed and left. I felt disgusting on my way home.   I posted about this a few months ago to ask for advice on how to overcome guilt and crippling anxiety, and as helpful as people were, I still feel guilt and shame. I took steps to try and figure these feelings out (saw a counsellor, threw myself into different sports etc) but I just feel really, really low and I constantly think about it and all the possibilities that could happen (parents and friends finding out etc).   I came across this place online a few weeks later and found a site that lists what those types of places do (what I now know as ‘Happy Ending massages’) and it seems to be a common occurrence at this place (reviewers were continuing to review this place after I had been, and they are continuing to do so) so I don’t think I was the only customer that has received this at that place.   I’m single, 23 and I’ve never been in a sexual relationship before, so this incident was my first encounter.     I’m worried about these things:  1) How my future partner would perceive me if she knew about this incident or what my friends would think. 2) The encounter being filmed (the Robert Kraft revelations triggered this in my mind over the weekend) 3) The POTENTIAL human trafficking element (I’m not a horrible person and the fact I’m having so much stress about this demonstrates that).   4) Law enforcement tracking me down nine months after the event for allowing it to happen.  *I was also worried about pregnancy risks (her taking the tissues and using the sperm to get pregnant) and contracting a STI/STD.      I should say that (obviously this wasn’t a legitimate place) prostitution is legal where I live (big U.K. city) though activities around it i.e. pimping or soliciting in a public place (Street), are illegal.   I haven’t been back.   Thanks for reading.	https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/av1svu/i_23m_got_a_happy_ending_massage_nine_months_ago/		reddit	av1svu	confession	185.0	185.0	159.0	Remorse

Happy Holidays is offensive?	bobdig986	Aucun	2023-12-10 12:57:11	"Working as a cashier in a liquor store and wished a ""Happy Holidays"" to a customer. He responded in a very rude and offended way ""You can say Merry Christmas you know"". I told him ""I can say whatever I want to say"". He gives me dirty look and leaves. In fact, we are not supposed to say anything religious or political while at work, though I would have said the same.  Edit: This same guy previously had criticized the way I made change (computerized registers) and complained because the classic rock station that we  use for background played a Grateful Dead song. Hard to please seems to be his thing."	https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/18f329e/happy_holidays_is_offensive/		reddit	18f329e	mildlyinfuriating	2547.0	2547.0	1106.0
