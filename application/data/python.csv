Egg-smol Python: A Pythonic Library for E-graphs	Saul Shanabrook	Aucun	2023-05-07 15:35:17	E-graphs have emerged as a versatile data structure with applications in synthesis, optimization, and verification through techniques such as equality saturation. This paper introduces Python bindings for the experimental egg-smol library, which aims to bring the benefits of e-graphs to the Python ecosystem. The bindings offer a high-level, Pythonic API providing an accessible and familiar interface for Python users. By integrating e-graph techniques with Python, we hope to enable collaboration and innovation across various domains in the scientific computing and machine learning communities. We discuss the advantages of using Python bindings for both Python and existing egg-smol users, as well as possible future directions for development.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04311v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Making Python Code Idiomatic by Automatic Refactoring Non-Idiomatic
  Python Code with Pythonic Idioms"	Zejun Zhang	Zhenchang Xing, Xin Xia, Xiwei Xu, Liming Zhu	2022-07-12 15:30:46	Compared to other programming languages (e.g., Java), Python has more idioms to make Python code concise and efficient. Although pythonic idioms are well accepted in the Python community, Python programmers are often faced with many challenges in using them, for example, being unaware of certain pythonic idioms or do not know how to use them properly. Based on an analysis of 7,638 Python repositories on GitHub, we find that non-idiomatic Python code that can be implemented with pythonic idioms occurs frequently and widely. Unfortunately, there is no tool for automatically refactoring such non-idiomatic code into idiomatic code. In this paper, we design and implement an automatic refactoring tool to make Python code idiomatic. We identify nine pythonic idioms by systematically contrasting the abstract syntax grammar of Python and Java. Then we define the syntactic patterns for detecting non-idiomatic code for each pythonic idiom. Finally, we devise atomic AST-rewriting operations and refactoring steps to refactor non-idiomatic code into idiomatic code. We test and review over 4,115 refactorings applied to 1,065 Python projects from GitHub, and submit 90 pull requests for the 90 randomly sampled refactorings to 84 projects. These evaluations confirm the high-accuracy, practicality and usefulness of our refactoring tool on real-world Python code. Our refactoring tool can be accessed at 47.242.131.128:5000.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05613v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Modern Python at the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope	Tim Jenness	Aucun	2017-12-01 19:04:46	The LSST software systems make extensive use of Python, with almost all of it initially being developed solely in Python 2. Since LSST will be commissioned when Python 2 is end-of-lifed it is critical that we have all our code support Python 3 before commissioning begins. Over the past year we have made significant progress in migrating the bulk of the code from the Data Management system onto Python 3. This paper presents our migration methodology, and the current status of the port, with our eventual aim to be running completely on Python 3 by early 2018. We also discuss recent modernizations to our Python codebase.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00461v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Python GUI Scripting Interface for Running Atomic Physics Applications	Amani Tahat	Mofleh Tahat	2011-06-05 01:11:08	We create a Python GUI scripting interface working under Windows in addition to (UNIX/Linux). The GUI has been built around the Python open-source programming language. We use the Python's GUI library that so called Python Mega Widgets (PMW) and based on Tkinter Python module (http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/tutgui.htm). The new GUI was motivated primarily by the desire of more updated operations, more flexibility incorporating future and current improvements in producing atomic data. Furthermore it will be useful for a variety of applications of atomic physics, plasma physics and astrophysics and will help in calculating various atomic properties.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0868v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Towards Memory Safe Python Enclave for Security Sensitive Computation	Huibo Wang	Mingshen Sun, Qian Feng, Pei Wang, Tongxin Li, Yu Ding	2020-05-12 18:19:08	Intel SGX Guard eXtensions (SGX), a hardware-supported trusted execution environment (TEE), is designed to protect security-sensitive applications. However, since enclave applications are developed with memory unsafe languages such as C/C++, traditional memory corruption is not eliminated in SGX. Rust-SGX is the first toolkit providing enclave developers with a memory-language. However, Rust is considered a Systems language and has become the right choice for concurrent applications and web browsers. Many application domains such as Big Data, Machine Learning, Robotics, Computer Vision are more commonly developed in the python programming language. Therefore, Python application developers cannot benefit from secure enclaves like Intel SGX and rust-SGX. To fill this gap, we propose Python-SGX, which is a memory-safe SGX SDK providing enclave developers a memory-safe Python development environment. The key idea is to enable memory-safe Python language in SGX by solving the following key challenges: (1) defining a memory-safe Python interpreter (2)replacing unsafe elements of Python interpreter with safe ones,(3) achieving comparable performance to non-enclave Python applications, and (4) not introducing any unsafe new code or libraries into SGX. We propose to build Python-SGX with PyPy, a Python interpreter written by RPython, which is a subset of Python, and tame unsafe parts in PyPy by formal verification, security hardening, and memory safe language. We have implemented python-SGX and tested it with a series of benchmarks programs. Our evaluation results show that Python-SGX does not cause significant overhead.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05996v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Porting the LSST Data Management Pipeline Software to Python 3	Tim Jenness	Aucun	2016-11-02 19:48:34	The LSST data management science pipelines software consists of more than 100,000 lines of Python 2 code. LSST operations will begin after support for Python 2 has been dropped by the Python community in 2020, and we must therefore plan to migrate the codebase to Python 3. During the transition period we must also support our community of active Python 2 users and this complicates the porting significantly. We have decided to use the Python future package as the basis for our port to enable support for Python 2 and Python 3 simultaneously, whilst developing with a mindset more suited to Python 3. In this paper we report on the current status of the port and the difficulties that have been encountered.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00751v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A general approach for running Python codes in OpenFOAM using an
  embedded pybind11 Python interpreter"	Simon Rodriguez	Philip Cardiff	2022-03-30 15:25:03	As the overlap between traditional computational mechanics and machine learning grows, there is an increasing demand for straight-forward approaches to interface Python-based procedures with C++-based OpenFOAM. This article introduces one such general methodology, allowing the execution of Python code directly within an OpenFOAM solver without the need for Python code translation. The proposed approach is based on the lightweight library pybind11, where OpenFOAM data is transferred to an embedded Python interpreter for manipulation, and results are returned as needed. Following a review of related approaches, the article describes the approach, with a particular focus on data transfer between Python and OpenFOAM, executing Python scripts and functions, and practical details about the implementation in OpenFOAM. Three complementary test cases are presented to highlight the functionality and demonstrate the effect of different data transfer approaches: a Python-based velocity profile boundary condition; a Python-based solver for prototyping; and a machine learning mechanical constitutive law class for solids4foam which performs field calculations.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16394v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Teddy: Automatic Recommendation of Pythonic Idiom Usage For Pull-Based
  Software Projects"	Purit Phan-udom	Naruedon Wattanakul, Tattiya Sakulniwat, Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul, Thanwadee Sunetnanta, Morakot Choetkiertikul, Raula Gaikovina Kula	2020-09-05 12:54:57	Pythonic code is idiomatic code that follows guiding principles and practices within the Python community. Offering performance and readability benefits, Pythonic code is claimed to be widely adopted by experienced Python developers, but can be a learning curve to novice programmers. To aid with Pythonic learning, we create an automated tool, called Teddy, that can help checking the Pythonic idiom usage. The tool offers a prevention mode with Just-In-Time analysis to recommend the use of Pythonic idiom during code review and a detection mode with historical analysis to run a thorough scan of idiomatic and non-idiomatic code. In this paper, we first describe our tool and an evaluation of its performance. Furthermore, we present a case study that demonstrates how to use Teddy in a real-life scenario on an Open Source project. An evaluation shows that Teddy has high precision for detecting Pythonic idiom and non-Pythonic code. Using interactive visualizations, we demonstrate how novice programmers can navigate and identify Pythonic idiom and non-Pythonic code in their projects. Our video demo with the full interactive visualizations is available at https://youtu.be/vOCQReSvBxA.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03302v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Machine Learning using Stata/Python	Giovanni Cerulli	Aucun	2021-03-03 10:31:44	We present two related Stata modules, r_ml_stata and c_ml_stata, for fitting popular Machine Learning (ML) methods both in regression and classification settings. Using the recent Stata/Python integration platform (sfi) of Stata 16, these commands provide hyper-parameters' optimal tuning via K-fold cross-validation using greed search. More specifically, they make use of the Python Scikit-learn API to carry out both cross-validation and outcome/label prediction.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03122v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Using Python for Model Inference in Deep Learning	Zachary DeVito	Jason Ansel, Will Constable, Michael Suo, Ailing Zhang, Kim Hazelwood	2021-04-01 04:48:52	Python has become the de-facto language for training deep neural networks, coupling a large suite of scientific computing libraries with efficient libraries for tensor computation such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. However, when models are used for inference they are typically extracted from Python as TensorFlow graphs or TorchScript programs in order to meet performance and packaging constraints. The extraction process can be time consuming, impeding fast prototyping. We show how it is possible to meet these performance and packaging constraints while performing inference in Python. In particular, we present a way of using multiple Python interpreters within a single process to achieve scalable inference and describe a new container format for models that contains both native Python code and data. This approach simplifies the model deployment story by eliminating the model extraction step, and makes it easier to integrate existing performance-enhancing Python libraries. We evaluate our design on a suite of popular PyTorch models on Github, showing how they can be packaged in our inference format, and comparing their performance to TorchScript. For larger models, our packaged Python models perform the same as TorchScript, and for smaller models where there is some Python overhead, our multi-interpreter approach ensures inference is still scalable.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00254v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Python Type Hints are Turing Complete	Ori Roth	Aucun	2022-08-31 10:11:42	Grigore showed that Java generics are Turing complete by describing a reduction from Turing machines to Java subtyping. We apply Grigore's algorithm to Python type hints and deduce that they are Turing complete. In addition, we present an alternative reduction in which the Turing machines are simulated in real time, resulting in significantly lower compilation times. Our work is accompanied by a Python implementation of both reductions that compiles Turing machines into Python subtyping machines.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14755v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"OMB-Py: Python Micro-Benchmarks for Evaluating Performance of MPI
  Libraries on HPC Systems"	Nawras Alnaasan	Arpan Jain, Aamir Shafi, Hari Subramoni, Dhabaleswar K Panda	2021-10-20 16:59:14	Python has become a dominant programming language for emerging areas like Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Data Science (DS). An attractive feature of Python is that it provides easy-to-use programming interface while allowing library developers to enhance performance of their applications by harnessing the computing power offered by High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. Efficient communication is key to scaling applications on parallel systems, which is typically enabled by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard and compliant libraries on HPC hardware. mpi4py is a Python-based communication library that provides an MPI-like interface for Python applications allowing application developers to utilize parallel processing elements including GPUs. However, there is currently no benchmark suite to evaluate communication performance of mpi4py -- and Python MPI codes in general -- on modern HPC systems. In order to bridge this gap, we propose OMB-Py -- Python extensions to the open-source OSU Micro-Benchmark (OMB) suite -- aimed to evaluate communication performance of MPI-based parallel applications in Python. To the best of our knowledge, OMB-Py is the first communication benchmark suite for parallel Python applications. OMB-Py consists of a variety of point-to-point and collective communication benchmark tests that are implemented for a range of popular Python libraries including NumPy, CuPy, Numba, and PyCUDA. Our evaluation reveals that mpi4py introduces a small overhead when compared to native MPI libraries. We plan to publicly release OMB-Py to benefit the Python HPC community.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10659v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Does Coding in Pythonic Zen Peak Performance? Preliminary Experiments of
  Nine Pythonic Idioms at Scale"	Pattara Leelaprute	Bodin Chinthanet, Supatsara Wattanakriengkrai, Raula Gaikovina Kula, Pongchai Jaisri, Takashi Ishio	2022-03-28 04:05:54	In the field of data science, and for academics in general, the Python programming language is a popular choice, mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Evidence includes the versatile set of machine learning, data visualization, and manipulation packages used for the ever-growing size of available data. The Zen of Python is a set of guiding design principles that developers use to write acceptable and elegant Python code. Most principles revolve around simplicity. However, as the need to compute large amounts of data, performance has become a necessity for the Python programmer. The new idea in this paper is to confirm whether writing the Pythonic way peaks performance at scale. As a starting point, we conduct a set of preliminary experiments to evaluate nine Pythonic code examples by comparing the performance of both Pythonic and Non-Pythonic code snippets. Our results reveal that writing in Pythonic idioms may save memory and time. We show that incorporating list comprehension, generator expression, zip, and itertools.zip_longest idioms can save up to 7,000 MB and up to 32.25 seconds. The results open more questions on how they could be utilized in a real-world setting. The replication package includes all scripts, and the results are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5712349	http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14484v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

How fast can we make interpreted Python?	Russell Power	Alex Rubinsteyn	2013-06-25 17:57:00	Python is a popular dynamic language with a large part of its appeal coming from powerful libraries and extension modules. These augment the language and make it a productive environment for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from web development (Django) to numerical analysis (NumPy). Unfortunately, Python's performance is quite poor when compared to modern implementations of languages such as Lua and JavaScript.   Why does Python lag so far behind these other languages? As we show, the very same API and extension libraries that make Python a powerful language also make it very difficult to efficiently execute. Given that we want to retain access to the great extension libraries that already exist for Python, how fast can we make it?   To evaluate this, we designed and implemented Falcon, a high-performance bytecode interpreter fully compatible with the standard CPython interpreter. Falcon applies a number of well known optimizations and introduces several new techniques to speed up execution of Python bytecode. In our evaluation, we found Falcon an average of 25% faster than the standard Python interpreter on most benchmarks and in some cases about 2.5X faster.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6047v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Python Extension for the Massively Parallel Multiphysics Simulation
  Framework waLBerla"	Martin Bauer	Florian Schornbaum, Christian Godenschwager, Matthias Markl, Daniela Anderl, Harald Köstler, Ulrich Rüde	2015-11-23 15:06:47	We present a Python extension to the massively parallel HPC simulation toolkit waLBerla. waLBerla is a framework for stencil based algorithms operating on block-structured grids, with the main application field being fluid simulations in complex geometries using the lattice Boltzmann method. Careful performance engineering results in excellent node performance and good scalability to over 400,000 cores. To increase the usability and flexibility of the framework, a Python interface was developed. Python extensions are used at all stages of the simulation pipeline: They simplify and automate scenario setup, evaluation, and plotting. We show how our Python interface outperforms the existing text-file-based configuration mechanism, providing features like automatic nondimensionalization of physical quantities and handling of complex parameter dependencies. Furthermore, Python is used to process and evaluate results while the simulation is running, leading to smaller output files and the possibility to adjust parameters dependent on the current simulation state. C++ data structures are exported such that a seamless interfacing to other numerical Python libraries is possible. The expressive power of Python and the performance of C++ make development of efficient code with low time effort possible.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17445760.2015.1118478	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Building a scalable python distribution for HEP data analysis	David Lange	Aucun	2018-04-24 10:07:02	There are numerous approaches to building analysis applications across the high-energy physics community. Among them are Python-based, or at least Python-driven, analysis workflows. We aim to ease the adoption of a Python-based analysis toolkit by making it easier for non-expert users to gain access to Python tools for scientific analysis. Experimental software distributions and individual user analysis have quite different requirements. Distributions tend to worry most about stability, usability and reproducibility, while the users usually strive to be fast and nimble. We discuss how we built and now maintain a python distribution for analysis while satisfying requirements both a large software distribution (in our case, that of CMSSW) and user, or laptop, level analysis. We pursued the integration of tools used by the broader data science community as well as HEP developed (e.g., histogrammar, root_numpy) Python packages. We discuss concepts we investigated for package integration and testing, as well as issues we encountered through this process. Distribution and platform support are important topics. We discuss our approach and progress towards a sustainable infrastructure for supporting this Python stack for the CMS user community and for the broader HEP user community.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08939v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Performance of Python runtimes on a non-numeric scientific code	Riccardo Murri	Aucun	2014-04-25 10:55:48	The Python library FatGHol FatGHoL used in Murri2012 to reckon the rational homology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is an example of a non-numeric scientific code: most of the processing it does is generating graphs (represented by complex Python objects) and computing their isomorphisms (a triple of Python lists; again a nested data structure). These operations are repeated many times over: for example, the spaces and are triangulated by 4'583'322 and 747'664 graphs, respectively. This is an opportunity for every Python runtime to prove its strength in optimization. The purpose of this experiment was to assess the maturity of alternative Python runtimes, in terms of: compatibility with the language as implemented in CPython 2.7, and performance speedup. This paper compares the results and experiences from running FatGHol with different Python runtimes: CPython 2.7.5, PyPy 2.1, Cython 0.19, Numba 0.11, Nuitka 0.4.4 and Falcon.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6388v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Generating Python Code From Object-Z Specifications	A. F. Al Azzawi	M. Bettaz, H. M. Al-Refai	2018-02-17 11:41:24	Object-Z is an object-oriented specification language which extends the Z language with classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism that can be used to represent the specification of a complex system as collections of objects. There are a number of existing works that mapped Object-Z to C++ and Java programming languages. Since Python and Object-Z share many similarities, both are object-oriented paradigm, support set theory and predicate calculus moreover, Python is a functional programming language which is naturally closer to formal specifications, we propose a mapping from Object-Z specifications to Python code that covers some Object-Z constructs and express its specifications in Python to validate these specifications. The validations are used in the mapping covered preconditions, post-conditions, and invariants that are built using lambda function and Python's decorator. This work has found Python is an excellent language for developing libraries to map Object-Z specifications to Python.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06224v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Dune Python Module	Andreas Dedner	Martin Nolte	2018-07-13 19:17:48	In this paper we present the new Dune-Python module which provides Python bindings for the Dune core, which is a C++ environment for solving partial differential equations. The aim of this new module is to firstly provide the general infrastructure for exporting realizations of statically polymorphic interfaces based on just-in-time compilation and secondly to provide bindings for the central interfaces of the dune core modules. In the first release we focus on the grid interface. Our aim is to only introduce a thin layer when passing objects into Python which can be removed when the object is passed back into a C++ algorithm. Thus no efficiency is lost and little additional code maintenance cost is incurred. To make the transition for Dune users to the Python environment straightforward the Python classes provide a very similar interface to their C++ counterparts. In addition, vectorized versions of many interfaces allow for more efficient code on the Python side. The infrastructure for exporting these interfaces and the resulting bindings for a Dune grid are explained in detail in this paper for both experienced Dune users and others interested in a flexible Python environment for implementing grid based schemes for solving partial differential equations.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05252v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Image Processing in Python With Montage	John Good	G. Bruce Berriman	2019-08-26 15:50:25	The Montage image mosaic engine has found wide applicability in astronomy research, integration into processing environments, and is an examplar application for the development of advanced cyber-infrastructure. It is written in C to provide performance and portability. Linking C/C++ libraries to the Python kernel at run time as binary extensions allows them to run under Python at compiled speeds and enables users to take advantage of all the functionality in Python. We have built Python binary extensions of the 59 ANSI-C modules that make up version 5 of the Montage toolkit. This has involved a turning the code into a C library, with driver code fully separated to reproduce the calling sequence of the command-line tools; and then adding Python and C linkage code with the Cython library, which acts as a bridge between general C libraries and the Python interface. We will demonstrate how to use these Python binary extensions to perform image processing, including reprojecting and resampling images, rectifying background emission to a common level, creation of image mosaics that preserve the calibration and astrometric fidelity of the input images, creating visualizations with an adaptive stretch algorithm, processing HEALPix images, and analyzing and managing image metadata.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09753v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"An Analysis of Python's Topics, Trends, and Technologies Through Mining
  Stack Overflow Discussions"	Hamed Tahmooresi	Abbas Heydarnoori, Alireza Aghamohammadi	2020-04-14 02:59:16	Python is a popular, widely used, and general-purpose programming language. In spite of its ever-growing community, researchers have not performed much analysis on Python's topics, trends, and technologies which provides insights for developers about Python community trends and main issues. In this article, we examine the main topics related to this language being discussed by developers on one of the most popular Q\&A websites, Stack Overflow, as well as temporal trends through mining 2461876 posts. To be more useful for the software engineers, we study what Python provides as the alternative to popular technologies offered by common programming languages like Java. Our results indicate that discussions about Python standard features, web programming, and scientific programming. Programming in areas such as mathematics, data science, statistics, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and so forth. are the most popular areas in the Python community. At the same time, areas related to scientific programming are steadily receiving more attention from the Python developers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06280v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Python Workflows on HPC Systems	Dominik Strassel	Philipp Reusch, Janis Keuper	2020-12-01 09:51:12	The recent successes and wide spread application of compute intensive machine learning and data analytics methods have been boosting the usage of the Python programming language on HPC systems. While Python provides many advantages for the users, it has not been designed with a focus on multi-user environments or parallel programming - making it quite challenging to maintain stable and secure Python workflows on a HPC system. In this paper, we analyze the key problems induced by the usage of Python on HPC clusters and sketch appropriate workarounds for efficiently maintaining multi-user Python software environments, securing and restricting resources of Python jobs and containing Python processes, while focusing on Deep Learning applications running on GPU clusters.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00365v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Conflict-aware Inference of Python Compatible Runtime Environments with
  Domain Knowledge Graph"	Wei Cheng	Xiangrong Zhu, Wei Hu	2022-01-18 14:55:00	Code sharing and reuse is a widespread use practice in software engineering. Although a vast amount of open-source Python code is accessible on many online platforms, programmers often find it difficult to restore a successful runtime environment. Previous studies validated automatic inference of Python dependencies using pre-built knowledge bases. However, these studies do not cover sufficient knowledge to accurately match the Python code and also ignore the potential conflicts between their inferred dependencies, thus resulting in a low success rate of inference. In this paper, we propose PyCRE, a new approach to automatically inferring Python compatible runtime environments with domain knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, we design a domain-specific ontology for Python third-party packages and construct KGs for over 10,000 popular packages in Python 2 and Python 3. PyCRE discovers candidate libraries by measuring the matching degree between the known libraries and the third-party resources used in target code. For the NP-complete problem of dependency solving, we propose a heuristic graph traversal algorithm to efficiently guarantee the compatibility between packages. PyCRE achieves superior performance on a real-world dataset and efficiently resolves nearly half more import errors than previous methods.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07029v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Triangulating Python Performance Issues with Scalene	Emery D. Berger	Sam Stern, Juan Altmayer Pizzorno	2022-12-15 02:56:25	This paper proposes Scalene, a profiler specialized for Python. Scalene combines a suite of innovations to precisely and simultaneously profile CPU, memory, and GPU usage, all with low overhead. Scalene's CPU and memory profilers help Python programmers direct their optimization efforts by distinguishing between inefficient Python and efficient native execution time and memory usage. Scalene's memory profiler employs a novel sampling algorithm that lets it operate with low overhead yet high precision. It also incorporates a novel algorithm that automatically pinpoints memory leaks, whether within Python or across the Python-native boundary. Scalene tracks a new metric called copy volume, which highlights costly copying operations that can occur when Python silently converts between C and Python data representations, or between CPU and GPU. Since its introduction, Scalene has been widely adopted, with over 500,000 downloads to date. We present experience reports from developers who used Scalene to achieve significant performance improvements and memory savings.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07597v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Python for education: permutations	Andrzej Kapanowski	Aucun	2013-07-26 14:18:21	Python implementation of permutations is presented. Three classes are introduced: Perm for permutations, Group for permutation groups, and PermError to report any errors for both classes. The class Perm is based on Python dictionaries and utilize cycle notation. The methods of calculation for the perm order, parity, ranking and unranking are given. A random permutation generation is also shown. The class Group is very simple and it is also based on dictionaries. It is mainly the presentation of the permutation groups interface with methods for the group order, subgroups (normalizer, centralizer, center, stabilizer), orbits, and several tests. The corresponding Python code is contained in the modules perms and groups.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7042v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Pytrec_eval: An Extremely Fast Python Interface to trec_eval	Christophe Van Gysel	Maarten de Rijke	2018-05-04 03:37:03	We introduce pytrec_eval, a Python interface to the tree_eval information retrieval evaluation toolkit. pytrec_eval exposes the reference implementations of trec_eval within Python as a native extension. We show that pytrec_eval is around one order of magnitude faster than invoking trec_eval as a sub process from within Python. Compared to a native Python implementation of NDCG, pytrec_eval is twice as fast for practically-sized rankings. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in an application where pytrec_eval is combined with Pyndri and the OpenAI Gym where query expansion is learned using Q-learning.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210065	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Yaps: Python Frontend to Stan	Guillaume Baudart	Martin Hirzel, Kiran Kate, Louis Mandel, Avraham Shinnar	2018-12-06 01:24:29	Stan is a popular probabilistic programming language with a self-contained syntax and semantics that is close to graphical models. Unfortunately, existing embeddings of Stan in Python use multi-line strings. That approach forces users to switch between two different language styles, with no support for syntax highlighting or simple error reporting within the Stan code. This paper tackles the question of whether Stan could use Python syntax while retaining its self-contained semantics. The answer is yes, that can be accomplished by reinterpreting the Python syntax. This paper introduces Yaps, a new frontend to Stan based on reinterpreted Python. We tested Yaps on over a thousand Stan models and made it available open-source.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04125v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Nonparametric Estimation of the Random Coefficients Model in Python	Emil Mendoza	Fabian Dunker, Marco Reale	2021-08-08 07:27:49	We present $\textbf{PyRMLE}$, a Python module that implements Regularized Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the analysis of Random Coefficient models. $\textbf{PyRMLE}$ is simple to use and readily works with data formats that are typical to Random Coefficient problems. The module makes use of Python's scientific libraries $\textbf{NumPy}$ and $\textbf{SciPy}$ for computational efficiency. The main implementation of the algorithm is executed purely in Python code which takes advantage of Python's high-level features.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03582v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Running HMC Simulation with Python via QUDA	Shuhei Yamamoto	Simone Bacchio, Jacob Finenrath	2022-12-13 15:40:29	Lyncs-API is a Python API for Lattice QCD applications. It is designed as a Python toolkit that allows the user to use and run various lattice QCD libraries while programming in Python. The goal is to provide the user an easy programming experience without scarifying performance across multiple platforms, by preparing a common framework for various softwares for lattice QCD calculations. As such, it contains interfaces to, e.g., c-lime, DDalphaAMG, tmLQCD, and QUDA. In this proceeding, we focus on a Lyncs interface to QUDA, named Lyncs-QUDA, and present a small tutorial on how to use this Python interface to perform a HMC simulation using QUDA.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06657v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Python client for Isabelle server	Boris Shminke	Aucun	2022-12-09 12:05:28	We contribute a Python client for the Isabelle server, which gives researchers and students using Python as their primary programming language an opportunity to communicate with the Isabelle server through TCP directly from a Python script. Such an approach helps avoid the complexities of integrating the existing Python script with languages used for Isabelle development (ML and Scala). We also describe new features that appeared since the announcement of the first version of the client a year ago. Finally, we give examples of the client's applications in research and education and discuss known limitations and possible directions for future development.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11173v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"ePython: An implementation of Python for the many-core Epiphany
  coprocessor"	Nick Brown	Aucun	2020-10-28 09:01:27	The Epiphany is a many-core, low power, low on-chip memory architecture and one can very cheaply gain access to a number of parallel cores which is beneficial for HPC education and prototyping. The very low power nature of these architectures also means that there is potential for their use in future HPC machines, however there is a high barrier to entry in programming them due to the associated complexities and immaturity of supporting tools.   In this paper we present our work on ePython, a subset of Python for the Epiphany and similar many-core co-processors. Due to the limited on-chip memory per core we have developed a new Python interpreter and this, combined with additional support for parallelism, has meant that novices can take advantage of Python to very quickly write parallel codes on the Epiphany and explore concepts of HPC using a smaller scale parallel machine. The high level nature of Python opens up new possibilities on the Epiphany, we examine a computationally intensive Gauss-Seidel code from the programmability and performance perspective, discuss running Python hybrid on both the host CPU and Epiphany, and interoperability between a full Python interpreter on the CPU and ePython on the Epiphany. The result of this work is support for developing Python on the Epiphany, which can be applied to other similar architectures, that the community have already started to adopt and use to explore concepts of parallelism and HPC.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PyHPC.2016.012	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Characterizing Bugs in Python and R Data Analytics Programs	Shibbir Ahmed	Mohammad Wardat, Hamid Bagheri, Breno Dantas Cruz, Hridesh Rajan	2023-06-14 16:50:01	R and Python are among the most popular languages used in many critical data analytics tasks. However, we still do not fully understand the capabilities of these two languages w.r.t. bugs encountered in data analytics tasks. What type of bugs are common? What are the main root causes? What is the relation between bugs and root causes? How to mitigate these bugs? We present a comprehensive study of 5,068 Stack Overflow posts, 1,800 bug fix commits from GitHub repositories, and several GitHub issues of the most used libraries to understand bugs in R and Python. Our key findings include: while both R and Python have bugs due to inexperience with data analysis, Python see significantly larger data preprocessing bugs compared to R. Developers experience significantly more data flow bugs in R because intermediate results are often implicit. We also found changes and bugs in packages and libraries cause more bugs in R compared to Python while package or library misselection and conflicts cause more bugs in Python than R. While R has a slightly higher readability barrier for data analysts, the statistical power of R leads to a less number of bad performance bugs. In terms of data visualization, R packages have significantly more bugs than Python libraries. We also identified a strong correlation between comparable packages in R and Python despite their linguistic and methodological differences. Lastly, we contribute a large dataset of manually verified R and Python bugs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08632v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Simplifying Parallelization of Scientific Codes by a Function-Centric
  Approach in Python"	Jon K. Nilsen	Xing Cai, Bjorn Hoyland, Hans Petter Langtangen	2010-02-03 12:31:14	The purpose of this paper is to show how existing scientific software can be parallelized using a separate thin layer of Python code where all parallel communication is implemented. We provide specific examples on such layers of code, and these examples may act as templates for parallelizing a wide set of serial scientific codes. The use of Python for parallelization is motivated by the fact that the language is well suited for reusing existing serial codes programmed in other languages. The extreme flexibility of Python with regard to handling functions makes it very easy to wrap up decomposed computational tasks of a serial scientific application as Python functions. Many parallelization-specific components can be implemented as generic Python functions, which may take as input those functions that perform concrete computational tasks. The overall programming effort needed by this parallelization approach is rather limited, and the resulting parallel Python scripts have a compact and clean structure. The usefulness of the parallelization approach is exemplified by three different classes of applications in natural and social sciences.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1749-4699/3/1/015003	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"DockerizeMe: Automatic Inference of Environment Dependencies for Python
  Code Snippets"	Eric Horton	Chris Parnin	2019-05-27 11:23:29	Platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub's gist system promote the sharing of ideas and programming techniques via the distribution of code snippets designed to illustrate particular tasks. Python, a popular and fast-growing programming language, sees heavy use on both sites, with nearly one million questions asked on Stack Overflow and 400 thousand public gists on GitHub. Unfortunately, around 75% of the Python example code shared through these sites cannot be directly executed. When run in a clean environment, over 50% of public Python gists fail due to an import error for a missing library.   We present DockerizeMe, a technique for inferring the dependencies needed to execute a Python code snippet without import error. DockerizeMe starts with offline knowledge acquisition of the resources and dependencies for popular Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). It then builds Docker specifications using a graph-based inference procedure. Our inference procedure resolves import errors in 892 out of nearly 3,000 gists from the Gistable dataset for which Gistable's baseline approach could not find and install all dependencies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11127v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Fast fully-reproducible serial/parallel Monte Carlo and MCMC simulations
  and visualizations via ParaMonte::Python library"	Amir Shahmoradi	Fatemeh Bagheri, Joshua Alexander Osborne	2020-10-01 23:26:42	ParaMonte::Python (standing for Parallel Monte Carlo in Python) is a serial and MPI-parallelized library of (Markov Chain) Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines for sampling mathematical objective functions, in particular, the posterior distributions of parameters in Bayesian modeling and analysis in data science, Machine Learning, and scientific inference in general. In addition to providing access to fast high-performance serial/parallel Monte Carlo and MCMC sampling routines, the ParaMonte::Python library provides extensive post-processing and visualization tools that aim to automate and streamline the process of model calibration and uncertainty quantification in Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, the automatically-enabled restart functionality of ParaMonte::Python samplers ensure seamless fully-deterministic into-the-future restart of Monte Carlo simulations, should any interruptions happen. The ParaMonte::Python library is MIT-licensed and is permanently maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/tree/master/src/interface/Python.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00724v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Productivity, Portability, Performance: Data-Centric Python	Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas	Timo Schneider, Tal Ben-Nun, Alexandru Calotoiu, Tiziano De Matteis, Johannes de Fine Licht, Luca Lavarini, Torsten Hoefler	2021-07-01 15:51:18	Python has become the de facto language for scientific computing. Programming in Python is highly productive, mainly due to its rich science-oriented software ecosystem built around the NumPy module. As a result, the demand for Python support in High Performance Computing (HPC) has skyrocketed. However, the Python language itself does not necessarily offer high performance. In this work, we present a workflow that retains Python's high productivity while achieving portable performance across different architectures. The workflow's key features are HPC-oriented language extensions and a set of automatic optimizations powered by a data-centric intermediate representation. We show performance results and scaling across CPU, GPU, FPGA, and the Piz Daint supercomputer (up to 23,328 cores), with 2.47x and 3.75x speedups over previous-best solutions, first-ever Xilinx and Intel FPGA results of annotated Python, and up to 93.16% scaling efficiency on 512 nodes.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1122445.1122456	cs	arxiv					0.0	
PyTracer: Automatically profiling numerical instabilities in Python	Yohan Chatelain	Nigel Yong, Gregory Kiar, Tristan Glatard	2021-12-21 20:22:34	Numerical stability is a crucial requirement of reliable scientific computing. However, despite the pervasiveness of Python in data science, analyzing large Python programs remains challenging due to the lack of scalable numerical analysis tools available for this language. To fill this gap, we developed PyTracer, a profiler to quantify numerical instability in Python applications. PyTracer transparently instruments Python code to produce numerical traces and visualize them interactively in a Plotly dashboard. We designed PyTracer to be agnostic to numerical noise model, allowing for tool evaluation through Monte-Carlo Arithmetic, random rounding, random data perturbation, or structured noise for a particular application. We illustrate PyTracer's capabilities by testing the numerical stability of key functions in both SciPy and Scikit-learn, two dominant Python libraries for mathematical modeling. Through these evaluations, we demonstrate PyTracer as a scalable, automatic, and generic framework for numerical profiling in Python.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11508v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
GAP-Gen: Guided Automatic Python Code Generation	Junchen Zhao	Yurun Song, Junlin Wang, Ian G. Harris	2022-01-19 06:32:47	Automatic code generation from natural language descriptions can be highly beneficial during the process of software development. In this work, we propose GAP-Gen, a Guided Automatic Python Code Generation method based on Python syntactic constraints and semantic constraints. We first introduce Python syntactic constraints in the form of Syntax-Flow, which is a simplified version of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) reducing the size and high complexity of Abstract Syntax Tree but maintaining crucial syntactic information of Python code. In addition to Syntax-Flow, we introduce Variable-Flow which abstracts variable and function names consistently through out the code. In our work, rather than pretraining, we focus on modifying the finetuning process which reduces computational requirements but retains high generation performance on automatic Python code generation task. GAP-Gen fine-tunes the transformer based language models T5 and CodeT5 using the Code-to-Docstring datasets CodeSearchNet, CodeSearchNet AdvTest and Code-Docstring Corpus from EdinburghNLP. Our experiments show that GAP-Gen achieves better results on automatic Python code generation task than previous works.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08810v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Approaches to the Parallelization of Merge Sort in Python	Alexandra Yang	Aucun	2022-11-26 18:26:30	The theory of divide-and-conquer parallelization has been well-studied in the past, providing a solid basis upon which to explore different approaches to the parallelization of merge sort in Python. Python's simplicity and extensive selection of libraries make it the most popular scientific programming language, so it is a fitting language in which to implement and analyze these algorithms.   In this paper, we use Python packages multiprocessing and mpi4py to implement several different parallel merge sort algorithms. Experiments are conducted on an academic supercomputer, upon which benchmarks are performed using Cloudmesh. We find that hybrid multiprocessing merge sort outperforms several other algorithms, achieving a 1.5x speedup compared to the built-in Python sorted() and a 34x speedup compared to sequential merge sort. Our results provide insight into different approaches to implementing parallel merge sort in Python and contribute to the understanding of general divide-and-conquer parallelization in Python on both shared and distributed memory systems.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16479v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Faster or Slower? Performance Mystery of Python Idioms Unveiled with
  Empirical Evidence"	Zejun Zhang	Zhenchang Xing, Xin Xia, Xiwei Xu, Liming Zhu, Qinghua Lu	2023-01-30 03:28:24	The usage of Python idioms is popular among Python developers in a formative study of 101 performance-related questions of Python idioms on Stack Overflow, we find that developers often get confused about the performance impact of Python idioms and use anecdotal toy code or rely on personal project experience which is often contradictory in performance outcomes. There has been no large-scale, systematic empirical evidence to reconcile these performance debates. In the paper, we create a large synthetic dataset with 24,126 pairs of non-idiomatic and functionally-equivalent idiomatic code for the nine unique Python idioms identified in Zhang et al., and reuse a large real-project dataset of 54,879 such code pairs provided by Zhang et al. We develop a reliable performance measurement method to compare the speedup or slowdown by idiomatic code against non-idiomatic counterpart, and analyze the performance discrepancies between the synthetic and real-project code, the relationships between code features and performance changes, and the root causes of performance changes at the bytecode level. We summarize our findings as some actionable suggestions for using Python idioms.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12633v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Rapid Development of Interferometric Software Using MIRIAD and Python	Peter K. G. Williams	Casey J. Law, Geoffrey C. Bower	2012-03-01 22:07:31	"New and upgraded radio interferometers produce data at massive rates and will require significant improvements in analysis techniques to reach their promised levels of performance in a routine manner. Until these techniques are fully developed, productivity and accessibility in scientific programming environments will be key bottlenecks in the pipeline leading from data-taking to research results. We present an open-source software package, miriad-python, that allows access to the MIRIAD interferometric reduction system in the Python programming language. The modular design of MIRIAD and the high productivity and accessibility of Python provide an excellent foundation for rapid development of interferometric software. Several other projects with similar goals exist and we describe them and compare miriad-python to them in detail. Along with an overview of the package design, we present sample code and applications, including the detection of millisecond astrophysical transients, determination and application of nonstandard calibration parameters, interactive data visualization, and a reduction pipeline using a directed acyclic graph dependency model analogous to that of the traditional Unix tool ""make"". The key aspects of the miriad-python software project are documented. We find that miriad-python provides an extremely effective environment for prototyping new interferometric software, though certain existing packages provide far more infrastructure for some applications. While equivalent software written in compiled languages can be much faster than Python, there are many situations in which execution time is profitably exchanged for speed of development, code readability, accessibility to nonexpert programmers, quick interlinking with foreign software packages, and other virtues of the Python language."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/666604	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Toward Efficient Interactions between Python and Native Libraries	Jialiang Tan	Yu Chen, Zhenming Liu, Bin Ren, Shuaiwen Leon Song, Xipeng Shen, Xu Liu	2021-06-11 00:48:02	Python has become a popular programming language because of its excellent programmability. Many modern software packages utilize Python for high-level algorithm design and depend on native libraries written in C/C++/Fortran for efficient computation kernels. Interaction between Python code and native libraries introduces performance losses because of the abstraction lying on the boundary of Python and native libraries. On the one side, Python code, typically run with interpretation, is disjoint from its execution behavior. On the other side, native libraries do not include program semantics to understand algorithm defects.   To understand the interaction inefficiencies, we extensively study a large collection of Python software packages and categorize them according to the root causes of inefficiencies. We extract two inefficiency patterns that are common in interaction inefficiencies. Based on these patterns, we develop PieProf, a lightweight profiler, to pinpoint interaction inefficiencies in Python applications. The principle of PieProf is to measure the inefficiencies in the native execution and associate inefficiencies with high-level Python code to provide a holistic view. Guided by PieProf, we optimize 17 real-world applications, yielding speedups up to 6.3$\times$ on application level.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3468264.3468541	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Improving Tese Case Generation for Python Native Libraries Through
  Constraints on Input Data Structures"	Xin Zhang	Xutong Ma, Jiwen Yan, Baoquan Cui, Jun Yan, Jian Zhang	2022-06-28 08:47:33	Modern Python projects execute computational functions using native libraries and give Python interfaces to boost execution speed; hence, testing these libraries becomes critical to the project's robustness. One challenge is that existing approaches use coverage to guide generation, but native libraries run as black boxes to Python code with no execution information. Another is that dynamic binary instrumentation reduces testing performance as it needs to monitor both native libraries and the Python virtual machine.   To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an automated test case generation approach that works at the Python code layer. Our insight is that many path conditions in native libraries are for processing input data structures through interacting with the VM. In our approach, we instrument the Python Interpreter to monitor the interactions between native libraries and VM, derive constraints on the structures, and then use the constraints to guide test case generation. We implement our approach in a tool named PyCing and apply it to six widely-used Python projects. The experimental results reveal that with the structure constraint guidance, PyCing can cover more execution paths than existing test cases and state-of-the-art tools. Also, with the checkers in the testing framework Pytest, PyCing can identify segmentation faults in 10 Python interfaces and memory leaks in 9. Our instrumentation strategy also has an acceptable influence on testing efficiency.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13828v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"binary_c-python: A Python-based stellar population synthesis tool and
  interface to binary_c"	D. D. Hendriks	R. G. Izzard	2023-06-05 11:04:17	We present the software package binary_c-python which provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface to the binary_c framework, allowing the user to rapidly evolve individual systems and populations of stars. binary_c-python is available on Pip and on GitLab. binary_c-python contains many useful features to control and process the output of binary_c, like by providing binary_c-python with logging statements that are dynamically compiled and loaded into binary_c. Moreover, we have recently added standardised output of events like Roche-lobe overflow or double compact-object formation to binary_c, and automatic parsing and managing of that output in binary_c-python. binary_c-python uses multiprocessing to utilise all the cores on a particular machine, and can run populations with HPC cluster workload managers like HTCondor and Slurm, allowing the user to run simulations on large computing clusters. We provide documentation that is automatically generated based on docstrings and a suite of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks consist of technical tutorials on how to use binary_c-python and use-case scenarios aimed at doing science. Much of binary_c-python is covered by unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness, and the test coverage is continually increased as the package is improved.	http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.04642	cs	arxiv					0.0

  (SOFA) Service"	Jianghui Ji	Dongjie Tan, Chunhui Bao, Xiumin Huang, Shoucun Hu, Yao Dong, Su Wang	2023-10-12 19:11:41	The Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) is a service provided by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) that offers algorithms and software for astronomical calculations, which was released in two versions by FORTRAN 77 and ANSI C, respectively. In this work, we implement the python package PyMsOfa for SOFA service by three ways: (1) a python wrapper package based on a foreign function library for Python (ctypes), (2) a python wrapper package with the foreign function interface for Python calling C code (cffi), and (3) a python package directly written in pure python codes from SOFA subroutines. The package PyMsOfa has fully implemented 247 functions of the original SOFA routines. In addition, PyMsOfa is also extensively examined, which is exactly consistent with those test examples given by the original SOFA. This python package can be suitable to not only the astrometric detection of habitable planets of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) mission (Ji et al. 2022), but also for the frontiers themes of black holes and dark matter related to astrometric calculations and other fields.

A Practical Python API for Querying AFLOWLIB	Conred W.

It provides an easy way to integrate aflowlib data with other python materials packages such as ase and quippy, and provides automatic deserialization into numpy arrays and python objects. This package is available via ""pip install aflow""."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00813v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
salmon: A Symbolic Linear Regression Package for Python	Alex Boyd	Dennis L. Sun	2019-11-02 04:42:28	One of the most attractive features of R is its linear modeling capabilities. We describe a Python package, salmon, that brings the best of R's linear modeling functionality to Python in a Pythonic way -- by providing composable objects for specifying and fitting linear models. This object-oriented design also enables other features that enhance ease-of-use, such as automatic visualizations and intelligent model building.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00648v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
pySiDR: Python Event Reconstruction for SiD	C. T. Potter	Aucun	2020-02-13 22:43:25	Event reconstruction in the ILC community has typically relied on algorithms implemented in C++, a fast compiled language. However, the Python package pyLCIO provides a full interface to tracker and calorimeter hits stored in LCIO files, opening up the possibility to implement reconstruction algorithms in a language uniquely well suited to working with large lists of hits built with list comprehensions. Python, an interpreted language which can perform complex tasks with minimal code, also allows seamless integration with powerful machine learning tools developed recently. We discuss pySiDR, a Python package for SiD event reconstruction.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05804v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"FitsGeo -- Python package for PHITS geometry development and

Suggested FitsGeo Python package helps to define surfaces as Python objects and manipulate them conveniently. VPython assists to view defined geometry interactively which boosts geometry development and helps with complicated cases. Every class that sets the surface object has methods with some extra properties. As well as geometry generation for PHITS input, additional modules developed for material and cell definition. Any user with a very basic knowledge of Python can define the geometry in a convenient way and use it in further research related to particle transport.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03298v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
HDPython: A High Level Python Based Object-Oriented HDL Framework	R. Peschke	K. Nishimura, G. Varner	2020-11-05 02:43:50	We present a High-Level Python-based Hardware Description Language (HDPython), It uses Python as its source language and converts it to standard VHDL. Compared to other approaches of building converters from a high-level programming language into a hardware description language, this new approach aims to maintain an object-oriented paradigm throughout the entire process. Instead of removing all the high-level features from Python to make it into an HDL, this approach goes the opposite way. It tries to show how certain features from a high-level language can be implemented in an HDL, providing the corresponding benefits of high-level programming for the user.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02626v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Asgl: A Python Package for Penalized Linear and Quantile Regression	Álvaro Méndez Civieta	M. Carmen Aguilera-Morillo, Rosa E. Lillo	2021-10-31 11:43:10	Asg is a Python package that solves penalized linear regression and quantile regression models for simultaneous variable selection and prediction, for both high and low dimensional frameworks. It makes very easy to set up and solve different types of lasso-based penalizations among which the asgl (adaptive sparse group lasso, that gives name to the package) is remarked. This package is built on top of cvxpy, a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems and makes extensive use of multiprocessing, a Python module for parallel computing that significantly reduces computation times of asgl.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00472v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Scalpel: The Python Static Analysis Framework	Li Li	Jiawei Wang, Haowei Quan	2022-02-24 00:27:56	Despite being the most popular programming language, Python has not yet received enough attention from the community. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general static analysis framework proposed to facilitate the implementation of dedicated Python static analyzers. To fill this gap, we design and implement such a framework (named Scalpel) and make it publicly available as an open-source project. The Scalpel framework has already integrated a number of fundamental static analysis functions (e.g., call graph constructions, control-flow graph constructions, alias analysis, etc.) that are ready to be reused by developers to implement client applications focusing on statically resolving dedicated Python problems such as detecting bugs or fixing vulnerabilities.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11840v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

PythonFOAM: In-situ data analyses with OpenFOAM and Python	Romit Maulik	Dimitrios Fytanidis, Bethany Lusch, Venkatram Vishwanath, Saumil Patel	2021-03-17 01:34:41	We outline the development of a general-purpose Python-based data analysis tool for OpenFOAM. Our implementation relies on the construction of OpenFOAM applications that have bindings to data analysis libraries in Python. Double precision data in OpenFOAM is cast to a NumPy array using the NumPy C-API and Python modules may then be used for arbitrary data analysis and manipulation on flow-field information. We highlight how the proposed wrapper may be used for an in-situ online singular value decomposition (SVD) implemented in Python and accessed from the OpenFOAM solver PimpleFOAM. Here, `in-situ' refers to a programming paradigm that allows for a concurrent computation of the data analysis on the same computational resources utilized for the partial differential equation solver. In addition, to demonstrate data-parallel analyses, we deploy a distributed SVD, which collects snapshot data across the ranks of a distributed simulation to compute the global left singular vectors. Crucially, both OpenFOAM and Python share the same message passing interface (MPI) communicator for this deployment which allows Python objects and functions to exchange NumPy arrays across ranks. Subsequently, we provide scaling assessments of this distributed SVD on multiple nodes of Intel Broadwell and KNL architectures for canonical test cases such as the large eddy simulations of a backward facing step and a channel flow at friction Reynolds number of 395. Finally, we demonstrate the deployment of a deep neural network for compressing the flow-field information using an autoencoder to demonstrate an ability to use state-of-the-art machine learning tools in the Python ecosystem.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09389v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Python Crypto Misuses in the Wild	Anna-Katharina Wickert	Lars Baumgärtner, Florian Breitfelder, Mira Mezini	2021-09-02 17:32:41	Background: Previous studies have shown that up to 99.59 % of the Java apps using crypto APIs misuse the API at least once. However, these studies have been conducted on Java and C, while empirical studies for other languages are missing. For example, a controlled user study with crypto tasks in Python has shown that 68.5 % of the professional developers write a secure solution for a crypto task. Aims: To understand if this observation holds for real-world code, we conducted a study of crypto misuses in Python. Method: We developed a static analysis tool that covers common misuses of 5 different Python crypto APIs. With this analysis, we analyzed 895 popular Python projects from GitHub and 51 MicroPython projects for embedded devices. Further, we compared our results with the findings of previous studies. Results: Our analysis reveals that 52.26 % of the Python projects have at least one misuse. Further, some Python crypto libraries API design helps developers from misusing crypto functions, which were much more common in studies conducted with Java and C code. Conclusion: We conclude that we can see a positive impact of the good API design on crypto misuses for Python applications. Further, our analysis of MicroPython projects reveals the importance of hybrid analyses.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3475716.3484195	cs	arxiv					0.0	
An array-oriented Python interface for FastJet	Aryan Roy	Jim Pivarski, Chad Wells Freer	2022-02-08 14:57:31	Analysis on HEP data is an iterative process in which the results of one step often inform the next. In an exploratory analysis, it is common to perform one computation on a collection of events, then view the results (often with histograms) to decide what to try next. Awkward Array is a Scikit-HEP Python package that enables data analysis with array-at-a-time operations to implement cuts as slices, combinatorics as composable functions, etc. However, most C++ HEP libraries, such as FastJet, have an imperative, one-particle-at-a-time interface, which would be inefficient in Python and goes against the grain of the array-at-a-time logic of scientific Python. Therefore, we developed fastjet, a pip-installable Python package that provides FastJet C++ binaries, the classic (particle-at-a-time) Python interface, and the new array-oriented interface for use with Awkward Array.   The new interface streamlines interoperability with scientific Python software beyond HEP, such as machine learning. In one case, adopting this library along with other array-oriented tools accelerated HEP analysis code by a factor of 20. It was designed to be easily integrated with libraries in the Scikit-HEP ecosystem, including Uproot (file I/O), hist (histogramming), Vector (Lorentz vectors), and Coffea (high-level glue). We discuss the design of the fastjet Python library, integrating the classic interface with the array oriented interface and with the Vector library for Lorentz vector operations. The new interface was developed as open source.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2438/1/012011	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Deep Learning: From Basics to Building Deep Neural Networks with Python	Milad Vazan	Aucun	2022-04-22 11:57:19	This book is intended for beginners who have no familiarity with deep learning.

The Awkward World of Python and C++	Manasvi Goyal	Ianna Osborne, Jim Pivarski	2023-03-03 20:33:50	There are undeniable benefits of binding Python and C++ to take advantage of the best features of both languages. This is especially relevant to the HEP and other scientific communities that have invested heavily in the C++ frameworks and are rapidly moving their data analyses to Python. Version 2 of Awkward Array, a Scikit-HEP Python library, introduces a set of header-only C++ libraries that do not depend on any application binary interface. Users can directly include these libraries in their compilation rather than linking against platform-specific libraries. This new development makes the integration of Awkward Arrays into other projects easier and more portable as the implementation is easily separable from the rest of the Awkward Array codebase. The code is minimal, it does not include all of the code needed to use Awkward Arrays in Python, nor does it include references to Python or pybind11. The C++ users can use it to make arrays and then copy them to Python without any specialized data types - only raw buffers, strings, and integers. This C++ code also simplifies the process of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in ROOT. This implementation approach solves some of the drawbacks, like packaging projects where native dependencies can be challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the technique to integrate C++ and Python by using a header-only approach. We also describe the implementation of a new LayoutBuilder and a GrowableBuffer. Furthermore, examples of wrapping the C++ data into Awkward Arrays and exposing Awkward Arrays to C++ without copying them are discussed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02205v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
SlipCover: Near Zero-Overhead Code Coverage for Python	Juan Altmayer Pizzorno	Emery D Berger	2023-05-04 14:49:44	Coverage analysis is widely used but can suffer from high overhead. This overhead is especially acute in the context of Python, which is already notoriously slow (a recent study observes a roughly 30x slowdown vs. native code). We find that the state-of-the-art coverage tool for Python, coverage$.$py, introduces a median overhead of 180% with the standard Python interpreter. Slowdowns are even more extreme when using PyPy, a JIT-compiled Python implementation, with coverage$.$py imposing a median overhead of 1,300%. This performance degradation reduces the utility of coverage analysis in most use cases, including testing and fuzzing, and precludes its use in deployment. This paper presents SlipCover, a novel, near-zero overhead coverage analyzer for Python. SlipCover works without modifications to either the Python interpreter or PyPy. It first processes a program's AST to accurately identify all branches and lines. SlipCover then dynamically rewrites Python bytecodes to add lightweight instrumentation to each identified branch and line. At run time, SlipCover periodically de-instruments already-covered lines and branches. The result is extremely low overheads -- a median of just 5% -- making SlipCover suitable for use in deployment. We show its efficiency can translate to significant increases in the speed of coverage-based clients. As a proof of concept, we integrate SlipCover into TPBT, a targeted property-based testing system, and observe a 22x speedup.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3597926.3598128	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy Measurement From Python V	K. Coble	S. Dodelson, M. Dragovan, K. Ganga, L. Knox, J. Kovac, B. Ratra, T. Souradeep	2001-12-21 01:09:38	We analyze observations of the microwave sky made with the Python experiment in its fifth year of operation at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. After modeling the noise and constructing a map, we extract the cosmic signal from the data. We simultaneously estimate the angular power spectrum in eight bands ranging from large (l ~ 40) to small (l ~ 260) angular scales, with power detected in the first six bands. There is a significant rise in the power spectrum from large to smaller (l ~ 200) scales, consistent with that expected from acoustic oscillations in the early Universe. We compare this Python V map to a map made from data taken in the third year of Python. Python III observations were made at a frequency of 90 GHz and covered a subset of the region of the sky covered by Python V observations, which were made at 40 GHz. Good agreement is obtained both visually (with a filtered version of the map) and via a likelihood ratio test.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/345714	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Solve the Master Equation by Python-An Introduction to the Python
  Computing Environment"	Wei Fan	Yan Xu, Bing Chen, Qianqian Ye	2011-03-02 00:46:20	A brief introduction to the Python computing environment is given. By solving the master equation encountered in quantum transport, we give an example of how to solve the ODE problems in Python. The ODE solvers used are the ZVODE routine in Scipy and the bsimp solver in GSL. For the former, the equation can be in its complex-valued form, while for the latter, it has to be rewritten to a real-valued form. The focus is on the detailed workflow of the implementation process, rather than on the syntax of the python language, with the hope to help readers simulate their own models in Python.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0325v4	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Speeding simulation analysis up with yt and Intel Distribution for
  Python"	Salvatore Cielo	Luigi Iapichino, Fabio Baruffa	2019-10-17 12:28:46	As modern scientific simulations grow ever more in size and complexity, even their analysis and post-processing becomes increasingly demanding, calling for the use of HPC resources and methods. yt is a parallel, open source post-processing python package for numerical simulations in astrophysics, made popular by its cross-format compatibility, its active community of developers and its integration with several other professional Python instruments. The Intel Distribution for Python enhances yt's performance and parallel scalability, through the optimization of lower-level libraries Numpy and Scipy, which make use of the optimized Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel-MKL) and the Intel MPI library for distributed computing. The library package yt is used for several analysis tasks, including integration of derived quantities, volumetric rendering, 2D phase plots, cosmological halo analysis and production of synthetic X-ray observation. In this paper, we provide a brief tutorial for the installation of yt and the Intel Distribution for Python, and the execution of each analysis task. Compared to the Anaconda python distribution, using the provided solution one can achieve net speedups up to 4.6x on Intel Xeon Scalable processors (codename Skylake).	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07855v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Extending Python for Quantum-Classical Computing via Quantum
  Just-in-Time Compilation"	Thien Nguyen	Alexander J. McCaskey	2021-05-10 21:11:21	Python is a popular programming language known for its flexibility, usability, readability, and focus on developer productivity. The quantum software community has adopted Python on a number of large-scale efforts due to these characteristics, as well as the remote nature of near-term quantum processors. The use of Python has enabled quick prototyping for quantum code that directly benefits pertinent research and development efforts in quantum scientific computing. However, this rapid prototyping ability comes at the cost of future performant integration for tightly-coupled CPU-QPU architectures with fast-feedback. Here we present a language extension to Python that enables heterogeneous quantum-classical computing via a robust C++ infrastructure for quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compilation. Our work builds off the QCOR C++ language extension and compiler infrastructure to enable a single-source, quantum hardware-agnostic approach to quantum-classical computing that retains the performance required for tightly coupled CPU-QPU compute models. We detail this Pythonic extension, its programming model and underlying software architecture, and provide a robust set of examples to demonstrate the utility of our approach.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04671v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Scalene: Scripting-Language Aware Profiling for Python	Emery D. Berger	Aucun	2020-06-06 14:43:09	"Existing profilers for scripting languages (a.k.a. ""glue"" languages) like Python suffer from numerous problems that drastically limit their usefulness. They impose order-of-magnitude overheads, report information at too coarse a granularity, or fail in the face of threads. Worse, past profilers---essentially variants of their counterparts for C---are oblivious to the fact that optimizing code in scripting languages requires information about code spanning the divide between the scripting language and libraries written in compiled languages.   This paper introduces scripting-language aware profiling, and presents Scalene, an implementation of scripting-language aware profiling for Python. Scalene employs a combination of sampling, inference, and disassembly of byte-codes to efficiently and precisely attribute execution time and memory usage to either Python, which developers can optimize, or library code, which they cannot. It includes a novel sampling memory allocator that reports line-level memory consumption and trends with low overhead, helping developers reduce footprints and identify leaks. Finally, it introduces a new metric, copy volume, to help developers root out insidious copying costs across the Python/library boundary, which can drastically degrade performance. Scalene works for single or multi-threaded Python code, is precise, reporting detailed information at the line granularity, while imposing modest overheads (26%--53%)."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03879v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
An Empirical Study of Automated Unit Test Generation for Python	Stephan Lukasczyk	Florian Kroiß, Gordon Fraser	2021-11-09 08:54:33	Various mature automated test generation tools exist for statically typed programming languages such as Java. Automatically generating unit tests for dynamically typed programming languages such as Python, however, is substantially more difficult due to the dynamic nature of these languages as well as the lack of type information. Our Pynguin framework provides automated unit test generation for Python. In this paper, we extend our previous work on Pynguin to support more aspects of the Python language, and by studying a larger variety of well-established state of the art test-generation algorithms, namely DynaMOSA, MIO, and MOSA. Furthermore, we improved our Pynguin tool to generate regression assertions, whose quality we also evaluate. Our experiments confirm that evolutionary algorithms can outperform random test generation also in the context of Python, and similar to the Java world, DynaMOSA yields the highest coverage results. However, our results also demonstrate that there are still fundamental remaining issues, such as inferring type information for code without this information, currently limiting the effectiveness of test generation for Python.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05003v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"An Exploratory Study on the Predominant Programming Paradigms in Python
  Code"	Robert Dyer	Jigyasa Chauhan	2022-09-05 08:03:20	Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that fully supports object-oriented (OO) programming. The language allows writing code in a non-procedural imperative manner, using procedures, using classes, or in a functional style. To date, no one has studied what paradigm(s), if any, are predominant in Python code and projects. In this work, we first define a technique to classify Python files into predominant paradigm(s). We then automate our approach and evaluate it against human judgements, showing over 80% agreement. We then analyze over 100k open-source Python projects, automatically classifying each source file and investigating the paradigm distributions. The results indicate Python developers tend to heavily favor OO features. We also observed a positive correlation between OO and procedural paradigms and the size of the project. And despite few files or projects being predominantly functional, we still found many functional feature uses.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3540250.3549158	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Data Set of Generalizable Python Code Change Patterns	Akalanka Galappaththi	Sarah Nadi	2023-04-11 04:59:26	Mining repetitive code changes from version control history is a common way of discovering unknown change patterns. Such change patterns can be used in code recommender systems or automated program repair techniques. While there are such tools and datasets exist for Java, there is little work on finding and recommending such changes in Python. In this paper, we present a data set of manually vetted generalizable Python repetitive code change patterns. We create a coding guideline to identify generalizable change patterns that can be used in automated tooling. We leverage the mined change patterns from recent work that mines repetitive changes in Python projects and use our coding guideline to manually review the patterns. For each change, we also record a description of the change and why it is applied along with other characteristics such as the number of projects it occurs in. This review process allows us to identify and share 72 Python change patterns that can be used to build and advance Python developer support tools.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04983v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Scalable Demand-Driven Call Graph Generation for Python	Yixuan Yan	Kaifeng Huang, Bihuan Chen, Zixin Tao, Xin Peng	2023-05-10 07:40:05	Call graph generation is the foundation of inter-procedural static analysis. PyCG is the state-of-the-art approach for generating call graphs for Python programs. Unfortunately, PyCG does not scale to large programs when adapted to whole-program analysis where dependent libraries are also analyzed. Further, PyCG does not support demand-driven analysis where only the reachable functions from given entry functions are analyzed. Moreover, PyCG is flow-insensitive and does not fully support Python's features, hindering its accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a scalable demand-driven approach for generating call graphs for Python programs, and implement it as a prototype tool Jarvis. Jarvis maintains an assignment graph (i.e., points-to relations between program identifiers) for each function in a program to allow reuse and improve scalability. Given a set of entry functions as the demands, Jarvis generates the call graph on-the-fly, where flow-sensitive intra-procedural analysis and inter-procedural analysis are conducted in turn. Our evaluation on a micro-benchmark of 135 small Python programs and a macro-benchmark of 6 real-world Python applications has demonstrated that Jarvis can significantly improve PyCG by at least 67% faster in time, 84% higher in precision, and at least 10% higher in recall.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05949v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Py-Tetrad and RPy-Tetrad: A New Python Interface with R Support for
  Tetrad Causal Search"	Joseph D. Ramsey	Bryan Andrews	2023-08-13 16:29:05	We give novel Python and R interfaces for the (Java) Tetrad project for causal modeling, search, and estimation. The Tetrad project is a mainstay in the literature, having been under consistent development for over 30 years. Some of its algorithms are now classics, like PC and FCI; others are recent developments. It is increasingly the case, however, that researchers need to access the underlying Java code from Python or R. Existing methods for doing this are inadequate. We provide new, up-to-date methods using the JPype Python-Java interface and the Reticulate Python-R interface, directly solving these issues. With the addition of some simple tools and the provision of working examples for both Python and R, using JPype and Reticulate to interface Python and R with Tetrad is straightforward and intuitive.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07346v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"High performance Python for direct numerical simulations of turbulent
  flows"	Mikael Mortensen	Hans Petter Langtangen	2016-02-11 08:12:37	Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores.   A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.02.005	cs	arxiv					0.0	
PyCG: Practical Call Graph Generation in Python	Vitalis Salis	Thodoris Sotiropoulos, Panos Louridas, Diomidis Spinellis, Dimitris Mitropoulos	2021-02-28 18:49:25	"Call graphs play an important role in different contexts, such as profiling and vulnerability propagation analysis. Generating call graphs in an efficient manner can be a challenging task when it comes to high-level languages that are modular and incorporate dynamic features and higher-order functions.   Despite the language's popularity, there have been very few tools aiming to generate call graphs for Python programs. Worse, these tools suffer from several effectiveness issues that limit their practicality in realistic programs. We propose a pragmatic, static approach for call graph generation in Python. We compute all assignment relations between program identifiers of functions, variables, classes, and modules through an inter-procedural analysis. Based on these assignment relations, we produce the resulting call graph by resolving all calls to potentially invoked functions. Notably, the underlying analysis is designed to be efficient and scalable, handling several Python features, such as modules, generators, function closures, and multiple inheritance.   We have evaluated our prototype implementation, which we call PyCG, using two benchmarks: a micro-benchmark suite containing small Python programs and a set of macro-benchmarks with several popular real-world Python packages. Our results indicate that PyCG can efficiently handle thousands of lines of code in less than a second (0.38 seconds for 1k LoC on average). Further, it outperforms the state-of-the-art for Python in both precision and recall: PyCG achieves high rates of precision ~99.2%, and adequate recall ~69.9%. Finally, we demonstrate how PyCG can aid dependency impact analysis by showcasing a potential enhancement to GitHub's ""security advisory"" notification service using a real-world example."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00587v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
PyArmadillo: a streamlined linear algebra library for Python	Jason Rumengan	Terry Yue Zhuo, Conrad Sanderson	2021-04-22 15:13:33	PyArmadillo is a linear algebra library for the Python language, with the aim of closely mirroring the programming interface of the widely used Armadillo C++ library, which in turn is deliberately similar to Matlab. PyArmadillo hence facilitates algorithm prototyping with Matlab-like syntax directly in Python, and relatively straightforward conversion of PyArmadillo-based Python code into performant Armadillo-based C++ code. The converted code can be used for purposes such as speeding up Python-based programs in conjunction with pybind11, or the integration of algorithms originally prototyped in Python into larger C++ codebases. PyArmadillo provides objects for matrices and cubes, as well as over 200 associated functions for manipulating data stored in the objects. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported. Various matrix factorisations are provided through integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in replacements such as Intel MKL or OpenBLAS. PyArmadillo is open-source software, distributed under the Apache 2.0 license; it can be obtained at https://pyarma.sourceforge.io or via the Python Package Index in precompiled form.	http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.03051	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Python for Smarter Cities: Comparison of Python libraries for static and
  interactive visualisations of large vector data"	Gregor Herda	Robert McNabb	2022-02-26 10:23:29	Local governments, as part of 'smart city' initiatives and to promote interoperability, are increasingly incorporating open-source software into their data management, analysis, and visualisation workflows. Python, with its concise and natural syntax, presents a low barrier to entry for municipal staff without computer science backgrounds. However, with regard to geospatial visualisations in particular, the range of available Python libraries has diversified to such an extent that identifying candidate libraries for specific use cases is a challenging undertaking. This study therefore assesses prominent, actively-developed visualisation libraries in the Python ecosystem with respect to their suitability for producing visualisations of large vector datasets. A simple visualisation task common in urban development is used to produce near-identical thematic maps across static and an interactive 'tracks' of comparison. All short-listed libraries were able to generate the sample map products for both a small and larger dataset. Code complexity differed more strongly for interactive visualisations. Formal and informal documentation channels are highlighted to outline available resources for flattening learning curves. CPU runtimes for the Python-based portion of the process chain differed starkly for both tracks, pointing to avenues for further research. These results demonstrate that the Python ecosystem offers local governments powerful tools, free of vendor lock-in and licensing fees, to produce performant and consistently formatted visualisations for both internal and public distribution.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13105v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
An Empirical Study of Fault Localization in Python Programs	Mohammad Rezaalipour	Carlo A. Furia	2023-05-31 13:21:30	Despite its massive popularity as a programming language, especially in novel domains like data science programs, there is comparatively little research about fault localization that targets Python. Even though it is plausible that several findings about programming languages like C/C++ and Java -- the most common choices for fault localization research -- carry over to other languages, whether the dynamic nature of Python and how the language is used in practice affect the capabilities of classic fault localization approaches remain open questions to investigate.   This paper is the first large-scale empirical study of fault localization on real-world Python programs and faults. Using Zou et al.'s recent large-scale empirical study of fault localization in Java as the basis of our study, we investigated the effectiveness (i.e., localization accuracy), efficiency (i.e., runtime performance), and other features (e.g., different entity granularities) of seven well-known fault-localization techniques in four families (spectrum-based, mutation-based, predicate switching, and stack-trace based) on 135 faults from 13 open-source Python projects from the BugsInPy curated collection.   The results replicate for Python several results known about Java, and shed light on whether Python's peculiarities affect the capabilities of fault localization. The replication package that accompanies this paper includes detailed data about our experiments, as well as the tool FauxPy that we implemented to conduct the study.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19834v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Does Python Smell Like Java? Tool Support for Design Defect Discovery in
  Python"	Nicole Vavrová	Vadim Zaytsev	2017-03-31 12:47:50	The context of this work is specification, detection and ultimately removal of detectable harmful patterns in source code that are associated with defects in design and implementation of software. In particular, we investigate five code smells and four antipatterns previously defined in papers and books. Our inquiry is about detecting those in source code written in Python programming language, which is substantially different from all prior research, most of which concerns Java or C-like languages. Our approach was that of software engineers: we have processed existing research literature on the topic, extracted both the abstract definitions of nine design defects and their concrete implementation specifications, implemented them all in a tool we have programmed and let it loose on a huge test set obtained from open source code from thousands of GitHub projects. When it comes to knowledge, we have found that more than twice as many methods in Python can be considered too long (statistically extremely longer than their neighbours within the same project) than in Java, but long parameter lists are seven times less likely to be found in Python code than in Java code. We have also found that Functional Decomposition, the way it was defined for Java, is not found in the Python code at all, and Spaghetti Code and God Classes are extremely rare there as well. The grounding and the confidence in these results comes from the fact that we have performed our experiments on 32'058'823 lines of Python code, which is by far the largest test set for a freely available Python parser. We have also designed the experiment in such a way that it aligned with prior research on design defect detection in Java in order to ease the comparison if we treat our own actions as a replication. Thus, the importance of the work is both in the unique open Python grammar of highest quality, tested on millions of lines of code, and in the design defect detection tool which works on something else than Java.	http://dx.doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2017/1/11	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Python I, II, and III CMB Anisotropy Measurement Constraints on Open and
  Flat-Lambda CDM Cosmogonies"	Graca Rocha	Radoslaw Stompor, Ken Ganga, Bharat Ratra, Stephen R. Platt, Naoshi Sugiyama, Krzysztof M. Gorski	1999-05-11 18:16:35	We use Python I, II, and III cosmic microwave background anisotropy data to constrain cosmogonies. We account for the Python beamwidth and calibration uncertainties. We consider open and spatially-flat-Lambda cold dark matter cosmogonies, with nonrelativistic-mass density parameter Omega_0 in the range 0.1--1, baryonic-mass density parameter Omega_B in the range (0.005--0.029) h^{-2}, and age of the universe t_0 in the range (10--20) Gyr. Marginalizing over all parameters but Omega_0, the combined Python data favors an open (spatially-flat-Lambda) model with Omega_0 simeq 0.2 (0.1). At the 2 sigma confidence level model normalizations deduced from the combined Python data are mostly consistent with those drawn from the DMR, UCSB South Pole 1994, ARGO, MAX 4 and 5, White Dish, and SuZIE data sets.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/307886	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Python-based Post-processing Toolset For Seismic Analyses	Steve Brasier	Fred Pollard	2014-12-19 16:09:16	This paper discusses the design and implementation of a Python-based toolset to aid in assessing the response of the UK's Advanced Gas Reactor nuclear power stations to earthquakes. The seismic analyses themselves are carried out with a commercial Finite Element solver, but understanding the raw model output this produces requires customised post-processing and visualisation tools. Extending the existing tools had become increasingly difficult and a decision was made to develop a new, Python-based toolset. This comprises of a post-processing framework (aftershock) which includes an embedded Python interpreter, and a plotting package (afterplot) based on numpy and matplotlib. The new toolset had to be significantly more flexible and easier to maintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of development to be carried out by engineers with little training in software development. The resulting architecture will be described with a focus on exploring how the design drivers were met and the successes and challenges arising from the choices made.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6410v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Weighted graph algorithms with Python	A. Kapanowski	Ł. Gałuszka	2015-04-29 12:20:20	Python implementation of selected weighted graph algorithms is presented. The minimal graph interface is defined together with several classes implementing this interface. Graph nodes can be any hashable Python objects. Directed edges are instances of the Edge class. Graphs are instances of the Graph class. It is based on the adjacency-list representation, but with fast lookup of nodes and neighbors (dict-of-dict structure). Other implementations of this class are also possible.   In this work, many algorithms are implemented using a unified approach. There are separate classes and modules devoted to different algorithms. Three algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree are implemented: the Boruvka's algorithm, the Prim's algorithm (three implementations), and the Kruskal's algorithm. Three algorithms for solving the single-source shortest path problem are implemented: the dag shortest path algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the Dijkstra's algorithm (two implementations). Two algorithms for solving all-pairs shortest path problem are implemented: the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the Johnson's algorithm.   All algorithms were tested by means of the unittest module, the Python unit testing framework. Additional computer experiments were done in order to compare real and theoretical computational complexity. The source code is available from the public GitHub repository.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07828v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Garbage Collection in JyNI - How to bridge Mark/Sweep and Reference
  Counting GC"	Stefan Richthofer	Aucun	2016-07-01 19:11:01	Jython is a Java-based Python implementation and the most seamless way to integrate Python and Java. It achieves high efficiency by compiling Python code to Java bytecode and thus letting Java's JIT optimize it - an approach that enables Python code to call Java functions or to subclass Java classes. It enables Python code to leverage Java's multithreading features and utilizes Java's built-in garbage collection (GC). However, it currently does not support CPython's C-API and thus does not support native extensions like NumPy and SciPy. Since most scientific code depends on such extensions, it is not runnable with Jython. Jython Native Interface (JyNI) is a compatibility layer that aims to provide CPython's native C extension API on top of Jython. JyNI is implemented using the Java Native Interface (JNI) and its native part is designed to be binary compatible with existing extension builds [...].	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00825v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Devito: Towards a generic Finite Difference DSL using Symbolic Python	Michael Lange	Navjot Kukreja, Mathias Louboutin, Fabio Luporini, Felippe Vieira, Vincenzo Pandolfo, Paulius Velesko, Paulius Kazakas, Gerard Gorman	2016-09-12 12:15:36	Domain specific languages (DSL) have been used in a variety of fields to express complex scientific problems in a concise manner and provide automated performance optimization for a range of computational architectures. As such DSLs provide a powerful mechanism to speed up scientific Python computation that goes beyond traditional vectorization and pre-compilation approaches, while allowing domain scientists to build applications within the comforts of the Python software ecosystem. In this paper we present Devito, a new finite difference DSL that provides optimized stencil computation from high-level problem specifications based on symbolic Python expressions. We demonstrate Devito's symbolic API and performance advantages over traditional Python acceleration methods before highlighting its use in the scientific context of seismic inversion problems.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03361v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Learn Python with the NBA Giveaway!	NukishPhilosophy	Aucun	2022-12-08 15:42:36	"Hi everyone,  I recently came out with a course on learning Python with NBA data for complete beginners. (some of you may know me from /r/fantasyfootball)  [Link to the course here](https://www.fantasydatapros.com/basketball)  This is a giveaway I'm doing for lifetime access. **Just upvote and comment anything below to enter**.   For those who don't know, Python is a beginner friendly programming language that's very popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with basketball.  The overall goal of the course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging subject matter you probably enjoy if you're on this sub - basketball. A lot of people have reported back to me that my courses are the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after countless udemy courses and e-books. I dont think thats because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great out ones there, prob better than me, who I've learned a ton from and owe a lot to like Brad Traversy, Corey Schafer, and Sentdex. I actually think the reason is because the best and most engaging way to learn to code is through subject matters that interest you. For example, a lot of beginner data science courses start you out by predicting housing prices.  That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to introduce you to predictive analysis by teaching you to make a model to predict the NBA MVP this season?   With this in mind, each section of the course has some sort of basketball/NBA focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. The course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to predict points scored for the season for certain players, predict who will be MVP, and rank players into tiers for fantasy basketball. It comes with 10 sections of material, 8 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I'm on Slack all day so I usually respond pretty quickly).  Anyway, the mods ok'd it, so I figured id do a giveaway - **just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select (with a python script, of course) 10 people to get free lifetime access to the course after the Nuggets game tonight.** (Will select more if a lot of people enter)  Thanks for reading. You guys are awesome  And good luck!  edit:  Some ppl asked about cost. It’s $55, but you can use the code `NBA` for $15 off  **Winners posted below. Congrats and thank you to everyone!! If you won will be reaching out tmrw.**  /u/vlrBielzera /u/close2storm /u/claudioo2 /u/g-fresh /u/AltruisticExternal19 /u/3ToedGiraffe /u/waleoh /u/No_Pizza7855 /u/anontss /u/StevePerry4L /u/xongz /u/Donton615 /u/hightops16 /u/bullet50000 /u/Jaerba /u/booyakuhhsha /u/Far-Consequence9800 /u/imaleftyyy /u/Deca-Dence-Fan /u/osherg"	https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/zg2i87/learn_python_with_the_nba_giveaway/		reddit	zg2i87	nba	3300.0	3300.0	2559.0
