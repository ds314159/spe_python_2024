"Impact of JD Bernal Thoughts in the Science of Science upon China:
  Implications for Quantitative Studies of Science Today"	Yong Zhao	Jian Du, Yishan Wu	2020-03-03 02:29:11	John Desmond Bernal (1901-1970) was one of the most eminent scientists in molecular biology, and also regarded as the founding father of the Science of Science. His book The Social Function of Science laid the theoretical foundations for the discipline. In this article, we summarize four chief characteristics of his ideas in the Science of Science: the socio-historical perspective, theoretical models, qualitative and quantitative approaches, and studies of science planning and policy. China has constantly reformed its scientific and technological system based on research evidence of the Science of Science. Therefore, we analyze the impact of Bernal Science-of-Science thoughts on the development of Science of Science in China, and discuss how they might be usefully taken still further in quantitative studies of science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02135v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Defining Data Science	Yangyong Zhu	Yun Xiong	2015-01-21 02:41:55	Data science is gaining more and more and widespread attention, but no consensus viewpoint on what data science is has emerged. As a new science, its objects of study and scientific issues should not be covered by established sciences. Data in cyberspace have formed what we call datanature. In the present paper, data science is defined as the science of exploring datanature.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05039v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Citizen Science in the European Open Science Cloud	Stephen Serjeant	Aucun	2023-07-13 16:48:53	The European Open Science Cloud aims to make all data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. By far the largest community of users of the European Open Science Cloud is the science-inclined public. These users need a more curated experience of open science than subject specialists, but nevertheless make very substantial research contributions in open science, especially in crowdsourced data mining, i.e. citizen science. This short, non-technical invited review presents applications of citizen science in the European Open Science Cloud, with a particular focus on astrophysics and astroparticle physics.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/epn/2023204	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Report on a Boston University Conference December 7-8, 2012 on 'How Can
  the History and Philosophy of Science Contribute to Contemporary U.S. Science
  Teaching?'"	Peter Garik	Yann Benétreau-Dupin	2015-03-03 23:35:54	This is an editorial report on the outcomes of an international conference sponsored by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) (REESE-1205273) to the School of Education at Boston University and the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University for a conference titled: How Can the History and Philosophy of Science Contribute to Contemporary U.S. Science Teaching? The presentations of the conference speakers and the reports of the working groups are reviewed. Multiple themes emerged for K-16 education from the perspective of the history and philosophy of science. Key ones were that: students need to understand that central to science is argumentation, criticism, and analysis; students should be educated to appreciate science as part of our culture; students should be educated to be science literate; what is meant by the nature of science as discussed in much of the science education literature must be broadened to accommodate a science literacy that includes preparation for socioscientific issues; teaching for science literacy requires the development of new assessment tools; and, it is difficult to change what science teachers do in their classrooms. The principal conclusions drawn by the editors are that: to prepare students to be citizens in a participatory democracy, science education must be embedded in a liberal arts education; science teachers alone cannot be expected to prepare students to be scientifically literate; and, to educate students for scientific literacy will require a new curriculum that is coordinated across the humanities, history/social studies, and science classrooms.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11191-014-9716-8	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Data Science in Perspective	Rogerio Rossi	Aucun	2022-01-15 13:51:12	Data and Science has stood out in the generation of results, whether in the projects of the scientific domain or business domain. CERN Project, Scientific Institutes, companies like Walmart, Google, Apple, among others, need data to present their results and make predictions in the competitive data world. Data and Science are words that together culminated in a globally recognized term called Data Science. Data Science is in its initial phase, possibly being part of formal sciences and also being presented as part of applied sciences, capable of generating value and supporting decision making. Data Science considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision making through data intelligence. In many cases, the application of the method (or part of it) is considered in Data Science projects in scientific domain (social sciences, bioinformatics, geospatial projects) or business domain (finance, logistic, retail), among others. In this sense, this article addresses the perspectives of Data Science as a multidisciplinary area, considering science and the scientific method, and its formal structure which integrate Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Science, also taking into account Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing Machine Learning, among others. The article also deals with the perspective of applied Data Science, since Data Science is used for generating value through scientific and business projects. Data Science persona is also discussed in the article, concerning the education of Data Science professionals and its corresponding profiles, since its projection changes the field of data in the world.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05852v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Philosophy as Integral to a Data Science Ethics Course	Sara Colando	Johanna Hardin	2023-10-03 21:25:26	There is wide agreement that ethical considerations are a valuable aspect of a data science curriculum, and to that end, many data science programs offer courses in data science ethics. There are not always, however, explicit connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing together key data science practices with ethical topics. The ethical topics were collated from sixteen data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to current data science practices, which is rife with potentially morally charged decision points.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02444v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Ten Research Challenge Areas in Data Science	Jeannette M. Wing	Aucun	2020-01-27 21:39:57	Although data science builds on knowledge from computer science, mathematics, statistics, and other disciplines, data science is a unique field with many mysteries to unlock: challenging scientific questions and pressing questions of societal importance. This article starts with meta-questions about data science as a discipline and then elaborates on ten ideas for the basis of a research agenda for data science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05658v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Science Factionalism: How Group Identity Language Affects Public
  Engagement with Misinformation and Debunking Narratives on a Popular Q&A
  Platform in China"	Kaiping Chen	Yepeng Jin, Anqi Shao	2021-12-15 08:40:27	Misinformation and intergroup bias are two pathologies challenging informed citizenship. This paper examines how identity language is used in misinformation and debunking messages about controversial science on Chinese digital public sphere, and their impact on how the public engage with science. We collected an eight-year time series dataset of public discussion (N=6039) on one of the most controversial science issues in China (GMO) from a popular Q&A platform, Zhihu. We found that both misinformation and debunking messages use a substantial amount of group identity languages when discussing the controversial science issue, which we define as science factionalism -- discussion about science is divided by factions that are formed upon science attitudes. We found that posts that use science factionalism receive more digital votes and comments, even among the science-savvy community in China. Science factionalism also increases the use of negativity in public discourse. We discussed the implications of how science factionalism interacts with the digital attention economy to affect public engagement with science misinformation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07968v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Examining psychology of science as a potential contributor to science
  policy"	Arash Mousavi	Reza Hafezi, Hasan Ahmadi	2023-09-17 08:07:25	The psychology of science is the least developed member of the family of science studies. It is growing, however, increasingly into a promising discipline. After a very brief review of this emerging sub-field of psychology, we call for it to be invited into the collection of social sciences that constitute the interdisciplinary field of science policy. Discussing the classic issue of resource allocation, this paper tries to indicate how prolific a new psychological conceptualization of this problem would be. Further, from a psychological perspective, this research will argue in favor of a more realistic conception of science which would be a complement to the existing one in science policy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09202v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Science as a Public Good: Public Use and Funding of Science	Yian Yin	Yuxiao Dong, Kuansan Wang, Dashun Wang, Benjamin F. Jones	2021-05-01 03:02:07	Knowledge of how science is consumed in public domains is essential for a deeper understanding of the role of science in human society. While science is heavily supported by public funding, common depictions suggest that scientific research remains an isolated or 'ivory tower' activity, with weak connectivity to public use, little relationship between the quality of research and its public use, and little correspondence between the funding of science and its public use. This paper introduces a measurement framework to examine public good features of science, allowing us to study public uses of science, the public funding of science, and how use and funding relate. Specifically, we integrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all scientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses across three public domains - government documents, the news media, and marketplace invention. We find that the public uses of science are extremely diverse, with different public domains drawing distinctively across scientific fields. Yet amidst these differences, we find key forms of alignment in the interface between science and society. First, despite concerns that the public does not engage high-quality science, we find universal alignment, in each scientific field and public domain, between what the public consumes and what is highly impactful within science. Second, despite myriad factors underpinning the public funding of science, the resulting allocation across fields presents a striking alignment with the field's collective public use. Overall, public uses of science present a rich landscape of specialized consumption, yet collectively science and society interface with remarkable, quantifiable alignment between scientific use, public use, and funding.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00152v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Art and Practice of Data Science Pipelines: A Comprehensive Study of
  Data Science Pipelines In Theory, In-The-Small, and In-The-Large"	Sumon Biswas	Mohammad Wardat, Hridesh Rajan	2021-12-02 20:16:03	Increasingly larger number of software systems today are including data science components for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The collection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate research and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand their nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural characteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data science in-the-small, and data science in-the-large. Our study analyzes three datasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related concepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data science pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science in-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub to understand data science in-the-large. Our study has led to three representations of data science pipelines that capture the essence of our subjects in theory, in-the-small, and in-the-large.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3510003.3510057	cs	arxiv					0.0

Defining data science: a new field of inquiry	Michael L Brodie	Aucun	2023-06-28 12:58:42	Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm. Its power, scope, and scale will surpass science, our most powerful research paradigm, to enable knowledge discovery and change our world. We have yet to understand and define it, vital to realizing its potential and managing its risks. Modern data science is in its infancy. Emerging slowly since 1962 and rapidly since 2000, it is a fundamentally new field of inquiry, one of the most active, powerful, and rapidly evolving 21st century innovations. Due to its value, power, and applicability, it is emerging in over 40 disciplines, hundreds of research areas, and thousands of applications. Millions of data science publications contain myriad definitions of data science and data science problem solving. Due to its infancy, many definitions are independent, application specific, mutually incomplete, redundant, or inconsistent, hence so is data science. This research addresses this data science multiple definitions challenge by proposing the development of coherent, unified definition based on a data science reference framework using a data science journal for the data science community to achieve such a definition. This paper provides candidate definitions for essential data science artifacts that are required to discuss such a definition. They are based on the classical research paradigm concept consisting of a philosophy of data science, the data science problem solving paradigm, and the six component data science reference framework (axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology, methods, technology) that is a frequently called for unifying framework with which to define, unify, and evolve data science. It presents challenges for defining data science, solution approaches, i.e., means for defining data science, and their requirements and benefits as the basis of a comprehensive solution.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16177v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science Learning via Participation in Online Citizen Science	Karen Masters	Eun Young Oh, Joe Cox, Brooke Simmons, Chris Lintott, Gary Graham, Anita Greenhill, Kate Holmes	2016-01-22 12:23:10	We investigate the development of scientific content knowledge of volunteers participating in online citizen science projects in the Zooniverse (www.zooniverse.org), including the astronomy projects Galaxy Zoo (www.galaxyzoo.org) and Planet Hunters (www.planethunters.org). We use econometric methods to test how measures of project participation relate to success in a science quiz, controlling for factors known to correlate with scientific knowledge. Citizen scientists believe they are learning about both the content and processes of science through their participation. Won't don't directly test the latter, but we find evidence to support the former - that more actively engaged participants perform better in a project-specific science knowledge quiz, even after controlling for their general science knowledge. We interpret this as evidence of learning of science content inspired by participation in online citizen science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05973v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Impact of International Cooperation for Sustaining Space-Science
  Programs"	Karan Jani	Aucun	2016-10-27 05:09:10	Space-science programs provide a wide range of application to a nation's key sectors of development: science-technology infrastructure, education, economy and national security. However, the cost of sustaining a space-science program has discouraged developing nations from participating in space activities, while developed nations have steadily cut down their space-science budget in past decade. In this study I investigate the role of international cooperation in building ambitious space-science programs, particularly in the context of developing nations. I devise a framework to quantify the impact of international collaborations in achieving the space-science goals as well as in enhancing the key sectors of development of a nation. I apply this framework on two case studies, (i) Indian Space Research Organization - a case of space-science program from a developing nation that has historically engaged in international collaborations, and (ii) International Space Station - a case for a long term collaboration between matured space-science programs. My study concludes that international cooperation in space can significantly enhance scope of science goals, but has relatively little return of investment towards science education and national security. I also highlight limitations of such space diplomacy in the case of China and SAARC nations, and list criteria for future investigation and case studies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08618v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
What is Science?	P C Hohenberg	Aucun	2017-04-05 19:05:04	This paper proposes a new definition of science based on the distinction between the activity of scientists and the product of that activity: the former is denoted (lower-case) science and the latter (upper-case) Science. These definitions are intended to clarify the nature of scientific knowledge, its authority as well as its limitations, and how scientific knowledge differs from other forms of human knowledge. The body of knowledge we call Science is exemplified by elementary arithmetic: it has the following properties: (i) Science is collective, public knowledge; (ii) Science is universal and free of contradiction; (iii) Science emerges from science; (iv) Science is nevertheless bathed in ignorance and subject to change. These properties imply that many questions that are of great interest to humanity are out of reach to Science, since they necessarily involve individual and group commitments and beliefs. Examples are questions of ethics, religion, politics, art and even technology, for which diversity is a fundamental virtue.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01614v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On The Theoretical Problematic of Arabic Physical Science Or Why Did
  Arabic Science Fail To Achieve The Copernican Revolution?"	Hisham Ghassib	Aucun	2012-08-26 09:40:23	A Hegelian version of the concept of problematic is used to investigate the underlying theoretical unity and structure of Arabic physical science (physics, astronomy and chemistry). A contradictory triad (associated with Platonism, Aristotelian philosophy and Ptolemaic science) is identified at the heart of the Arabic project for physical science. The paper focuses on the valiant attempts made by leading Arabic scientists to overcome these contradictions without transcending or tearing apart the prevailing problematic. The following question is then addressed: why was Arabic physical science reformist, rather than revolutionary, unlike Renaissance European physical science? An answer is proposed in terms of the history, nature and decline of Arabic rationalism.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5208v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Embracing Data Science	Adam Loy	Aucun	2016-07-04 12:40:15	Statistics is running the risk of appearing irrelevant to today's undergraduate students. Today's undergraduate students are familiar with data science projects and they judge statistics against what they have seen. Statistics, especially at the introductory level, should take inspiration from data science so that the discipline is not seen as somehow lesser than data science. This article provides a brief overview of data science, outlines ideas for how introductory courses could take inspiration from data science, and provides a reference to materials for developing stand-alone data science courses.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00858v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A New Task for the Philosophy of Science	Nicholas Maxwell	Aucun	2019-12-09 22:03:37	This paper argues that philosophers of science have before them an important new task that they urgently need to take up. It is to convince the scientific community to adopt and implement a new philosophy of science that does better justice to the deeply problematic basic intellectual aims of science than that which we have at present. Problematic aims evolve with evolving knowledge, that part of philosophy of science concerned with aims and methods thus becoming an integral part of science itself. The outcome of putting this new philosophy into scientific practice would be a new kind of science, both more intellectually rigorous and one that does better justice to the best interests of humanity.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04396v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Metrics and Mechanisms: Measuring the Unmeasurable in the Science of
  Science"	Lingfei Wu	Aniket Kittur, Hyejin Youn, Staša Milojević, Erin Leahey, Stephen M. Fiore, Yong Yeol Ahn	2021-11-14 05:57:11	What science does, what science could do, and how to make science work? If we want to know the answers to these questions, we need to be able to uncover the mechanisms of science, going beyond metrics that are easily collectible and quantifiable. In this perspective piece, we link metrics to mechanisms by demonstrating how emerging metrics of science not only offer complementaries to existing ones, but also shed light on the hidden structure and mechanisms of science. Based on fundamental properties of science, we classify existing theories and findings into: hot and cold science referring to attention shift between scientific fields, fast and slow science reflecting productivity of scientists and teams, soft and hard science revealing reproducibility of scientific research. We suggest that interest about mechanisms of science since Derek J. de Solla Price, Robert K. Merton, Eugene Garfield, and many others complement the zeitgeist in pursuing new, complex metrics without understanding the underlying processes. We propose that understanding and modeling the mechanisms of science condition effective development and application of metrics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07250v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Science-Operational Metrics and Issues for the ""Are We Alone?"" Movement"	Robert A. Brown	Aucun	2009-03-30 16:03:57	"A movement is underway to test the uniqueness of Earth. Sponsored primarily by NASA, it is enlisting talented researchers from many disciplines. It is conceiving new telescopes to discover and characterize other worlds like Earth around nearby stars and to obtain their spectra. The goal is to search for signs of biological activity and perhaps find other cradles of life.   Most effort thus far has focused on the optics to make such observations feasible. Relatively little attention has been paid to science operations--the link between instrument and science. Because of the special challenges presented by extrasolar planets, science-operational issues may be limiting factors for the ""Are We Alone?"" (AWA) movement. Science-operational metrics can help compare the merits of direct and astrometric planet searches, and estimate the concatenated completeness of searching followed by spectroscopy. This completeness is the prime science metric of the AWA program. Therefore, the goals of this white paper are to present representative calculations involving science-operational metrics, and to promote a science-operational perspective. We urge the Survey Committee to allow this perspective and such metrics to inform its plan for the future of AWA."	http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5139v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Big and Small	R. D. Ekers	Aucun	2010-04-24 13:54:08	Technology leads discovery in astronomy, as in all other areas of science, so growth in technology leads to the continual stream of new discoveries which makes our field so fascinating. Derek de Solla Price had analysed the discovery process in science in the 1960s and he introduced the terms 'Little Science' and 'Big Science' as part of his discussion of the role of exponential growth in science. I will show how the development of astronomical facilities has followed this same trend from 'Little Science' to 'Big Science' as a field matures. We can see this in the discoveries resulting in Nobel Prizes in astronomy. A more detailed analysis of discoveries in radio astronomy shows the same effect. I include a digression to look at how science progresses, comparing the roles of prediction, serendipity, measurement and explanation. Finally I comment on the differences between the 'Big Science' culture in Physics and in Astronomy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4279v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Informaticology: combining Computer Science, Data Science, and Fiction
  Science"	Jan A. Bergstra	Aucun	2012-10-24 19:24:59	Motivated by an intention to remedy current complications with Dutch terminology concerning informatics, the term informaticology is positioned to denote an academic counterpart of informatics where informatics is conceived of as a container for a coherent family of practical disciplines ranging from computer engineering and software engineering to network technology, data center management, information technology, and information management in a broad sense.   Informaticology escapes from the limitations of instrumental objectives and the perspective of usage that both restrict the scope of informatics. That is achieved by including fiction science in informaticology and by ranking fiction science on equal terms with computer science and data science, and framing (the study of) game design, evelopment, assessment and distribution, ranging from serious gaming to entertainment gaming, as a chapter of fiction science. A suggestion for the scope of fiction science is specified in some detail.   In order to illustrate the coherence of informaticology thus conceived, a potential application of fiction to the ontology of instruction sequences and to software quality assessment is sketched, thereby highlighting a possible role of fiction (science) within informaticology but outside gaming.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6636v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Data Science: A Comprehensive Overview	Longbing Cao	Aucun	2020-07-01 02:33:58	The twenty-first century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science. This article is the first in the field to draw a comprehensive big picture, in addition to offering rich observations, lessons and thinking about data science and analytics.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3076253	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Teaching Philosophy and Science of Space Exploration (PoSE)	Serife Tekin	Carmen Fies, Chris Packham	2022-02-22 19:12:02	"Capitalizing on the enthusiasm about space science in the general public, our goal as an interdisciplinary group of scholars is to design and teach a new team-taught interdisciplinary course, ""Philosophy and Science of Space Exploration (PoSE)"" at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) where we currently teach. We believe that this course will not only help overcome disciplinary silos to advance our understanding of space and critically examine its ethical ramifications, but also will better educate the public on how science works and help overcome the science skepticism that has unfortunately become more prominent in recent years. In what follows, we first juxtapose two seemingly contradictory trends: increased interest in space science on the one hand and increased skepticism about and distrust in science on the other. We then turn to how our anticipated Philosophy and Science of Space Exploration (PoSE) course will develop tools that could dismantle distrust in science while also enhancing the scientific and philosophical understandings of space science. We explain the content and the questions we will examine in POSE and conclude with how we will measure our success and progress."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11130v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A data science axiology: the nature, value, and risks of data science	Michael L. Brodie	Aucun	2023-07-19 21:12:04	Data science is not a science. It is a research paradigm with an unfathomed scope, scale, complexity, and power for knowledge discovery that is not otherwise possible and can be beyond human reasoning. It is changing our world practically and profoundly already widely deployed in tens of thousands of applications in every discipline in an AI Arms Race that, due to its inscrutability, can lead to unfathomed risks. This paper presents an axiology of data science, its purpose, nature, importance, risks, and value for problem solving, by exploring and evaluating its remarkable, definitive features. As data science is in its infancy, this initial, speculative axiology is intended to aid in understanding and defining data science to recognize its potential benefits, risks, and open research challenges. AI based data science is inherently about uncertainty that may be more realistic than our preference for the certainty of science. Data science will have impacts far beyond knowledge discovery and will take us into new ways of understanding the world.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10460v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science and Philosophy: A Love-Hate Relationship	Sebastian De Haro	Aucun	2013-07-04 09:02:00	"In this paper I review the problematic relationship between science and philosophy; in particular, I will address the question of whether science needs philosophy, and I will offer some positive perspectives that should be helpful in developing a synergetic relationship between the two. I will review three lines of reasoning often employed in arguing that philosophy is useless for science: a) philosophy's death diagnosis ('philosophy is dead'); b) the historic-agnostic argument/challenge ""show me examples where philosophy has been useful for science, for I don't know of any""; c) the division of property argument (or: philosophy and science have different subject matters, therefore philosophy is useless for science).   These arguments will be countered with three contentions to the effect that the natural sciences need philosophy. I will: a) point to the fallacy of anti-philosophicalism (or: 'in order to deny the need for philosophy, one must do philosophy') and examine the role of paradigms and presuppositions (or: why science can't live without philosophy); b) point out why the historical argument fails (in an example from quantum mechanics, alive and kicking); c) briefly sketch some domains of intersection of science and philosophy and how the two can have mutual synergy. I will conclude with some implications of this synergetic relationship between science and philosophy for the liberal arts and sciences."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10699-019-09619-2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
FAIR and Open Computer Science Research Software	Wilhelm Hasselbring	Leslie Carr, Simon Hettrick, Heather Packer, Thanassis Tiropanis	2019-08-16 14:26:08	In computational science and in computer science, research software is a central asset for research. Computational science is the application of computer science and software engineering principles to solving scientific problems, whereas computer science is the study of computer hardware and software design.   The Open Science agenda holds that science advances faster when we can build on existing results. Therefore, research software has to be reusable for advancing science. Thus, we need proper research software engineering for obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However, research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit from reuse when research software is involved.   For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open and adhere to the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and repeatable) to allow repeatability, reproducibility, and reuse. Compared to research data, research software should be both archived for reproducibility and actively maintained for reusability. The FAIR data principles do not require openness, but research software should be open source software. Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options, such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed.   We review and analyze the current state in this area in order to give recommendations for making computer science research software FAIR and open. We observe that research software publishing practices in computer science and in computational science show significant differences.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05986v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On the Nature of Science	B. K. Jennings	Aucun	2006-07-26 14:38:55	A 21st century view of the nature of science is presented. It attempts to show how a consistent description of science and scientific progress can be given. Science advances through a sequence of models with progressively greater predictive power. The philosophical and metaphysical implications of the models change in unpredictable ways as the predictive power increases. The view of science arrived at is one based on instrumentalism. Philosophical realism can only be recovered by a subtle use of Occam's razor. Error control is seen to be essential to scientific progress. The nature of the difference between science and religion is explored.	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607241v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Measurement Theory in the Philosophy of Science	Shiro Ishikawa	Aucun	2012-09-16 13:09:27	The philosophy of science is a discipline concerning the metaphysical aspect of science. Recently, I proposed measurement theory, which is characterized as the metaphysical and linguistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. I assert that this theory is one of the most fundamental languages in science, and thus, it is located at the central position in science. This assertion will be examined throughout this preprint, which is written as the draft of my future book (concerning the philosophy of science). Hence, I hope to hear various opinions about this draft.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3483v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Cosmology and Science Education: Problems and Promises	Helge Kragh	Aucun	2012-12-07 12:33:05	Cosmology differs in some respects significantly from other sciences, primarily because of its intimate association with issues of a conceptual and philosophical nature. Because cosmology in the broader sense relates to the world views held by students, it provides a means for bridging the gap between the teaching of science and the teaching of humanistic subjects. Students should of course learn to distinguish between what is right and wrong about the science of the universe. No less importantly, they should learn to recognize the limits of science and that there are questions about nature that may forever remain unanswered. Cosmology, more than any other science, is well suited to illuminate issues of this kind.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1592v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Materials science and engineering: New vision in the era of artificial
  intelligence"	Tao Qiang	Honghong Gao	2018-04-23 09:01:57	Scientific discovery evolves from the experimental, through the theoretical and computational, to the current data-intensive paradigm. Materials science is no exception, especially for computational materials science. In recent years, great achievements have been made in the field of materials science and engineering (MSE). Here, we review the previous paradigms of materials science and some classical MSE models. Then, our data-intensive MSE (DIMSE) model is proposed to reshape future materials innovations. This work will help to address the global challenge for materials discovery in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), and essentially contribute to accelerating future materials continuum.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08293v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Why The Trans Programmer?	Skye Kychenthal	Aucun	2022-05-03 15:06:23	Through online anecdotal evidence and online communities, there is an in-group idea of trans people (specifically trans-feminine individuals) disproportionately entering computer science education & fields. Existing data suggests this is a plausible trend, yet no research has been done into exactly why. As computer science education (traditional schooling or self-taught methods) is integral to working in computer science fields, a simple research survey was conducted to gather data on 138 trans people's experiences with computer science & computer science education. This article's purpose is to shed insight on the motivations for trans individuals choosing computer science paths, while acting as a basis and call to action for further research.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01553v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"ChatGPT for Teaching and Learning: An Experience from Data Science
  Education"	Yong Zheng	Aucun	2023-07-31 13:31:19	ChatGPT, an implementation and application of large language models, has gained significant popularity since its initial release. Researchers have been exploring ways to harness the practical benefits of ChatGPT in real-world scenarios. Educational researchers have investigated its potential in various subjects, e.g., programming, mathematics, finance, clinical decision support, etc. However, there has been limited attention given to its application in data science education. This paper aims to bridge that gap by utilizing ChatGPT in a data science course, gathering perspectives from students, and presenting our experiences and feedback on using ChatGPT for teaching and learning in data science education. The findings not only distinguish data science education from other disciplines but also uncover new opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating ChatGPT into the data science curriculum.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3585059.3611431	cs	arxiv					0.0

"How do scientific disciplines evolve in applied sciences? The properties
  of scientific fission and ambidextrous scientific drivers"	Mario Coccia	Aucun	2019-11-13 09:25:59	One of the fundamental questions in science is how scientific disciplines evolve and sustain progress in society. No studies to date allows us to explain the endogenous processes that support the evolution of scientific disciplines and emergence of new scientific fields in applied sciences of physics. This study confronts this problem here by investigating the evolution of experimental physics to explain and generalize some characteristics of the dynamics of applied sciences. Empirical analysis suggests properties about the evolution of experimental physics and in general of applied sciences, such as: a) scientific fission, the evolution of scientific disciplines generates a process of division into two or more research fields that evolve as autonomous entities over time; b) ambidextrous drivers of science, the evolution of science via scientific fission is due to scientific discoveries or new technologies; c) new driving research fields, the drivers of scientific disciplines are new research fields rather than old ones; d) science driven by development of general purpose technologies, the evolution of experimental physics and applied sciences is due to the convergence of experimental and theoretical branches of physics associated with the development of computer, information systems and applied computational science. Results also reveal that average duration of the upwave of scientific production in scientific fields supporting experimental physics is about 80 years. Overall, then, this study begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, some characteristics of the evolutionary dynamics of scientific disciplines that can lay a foundation for the development of comprehensive properties explaining the evolution of science as a whole for supporting fruitful research policy implications directed to advancement of science and technological progress in society.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05363v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Suyu	2021-11-17 16:16:20	We present the Strong Lensing Science Collaboration's (SLSC) recommended observing targets for the science verification and science validation phases of commissioning. Our recommendations have been developed in collaboration with the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Strong Lensing Topical Team. In summary, our key recommendations are as follows: (1) Prioritize fields that span the full range of declination observable from Cerro Pachon during the engineering focused Science Verification phase of commissioning, before concentrating on equatorial fields for the Science Validation surveys. (2) Observe quadruply lensed quasars as the ultimate test of the Active Optics system towards the end of the Science Verification phase of commissioning. These systems are the strongest tests known for delivered image quality. (3) Prioritize science validation survey fields (both single deep pointings and wide fields) that have been searched thoroughly by precursor surveys for strong lenses. (4) The optimal wide (~100 degree^2) science validation field would include the CFHT-LS W4 field, and overlap with the SDSS Stripe 82, DES-SN, KIDS and HSC-SSP fields. (5) The optimal single pointing science validation fields are the XMM-LSS and COSMOS Deep Drilling Fields, the equatorial Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, and strongly lensed quasars with measured time delays that are well-matched to commissioning timescales.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09216v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Data science transfer pathways from associate's to bachelor's programs	Benjamin S. Baumer	Nicholas J. Horton	2022-10-22 19:07:08	A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935 public two-year colleges. While the number of four-year colleges offering bachelor's degrees in data science continues to increase, data science instruction at many two-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of pre-defined transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally-disruptive solutions, and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.e2720e81	cs	arxiv					0.0

Several of these conceptualizations and models have visual manifestations supporting the combination and comparison of theories and approaches developed in different disciplines of science. Subsequently, we discuss challenges towards a theoretically grounded and practically useful science of science and provide a brief chronological review of relevant work. Then, we exemplarily present three conceptualizations of science that attempt to provide frameworks for the comparison and combination of existing approaches, theories, laws, and measurements. Finally, we discuss the contributions of and interlinkages among the eight papers included in this issue. Each paper makes a unique contribution towards conceptualizations and models of science and roots this contribution in a review and comparison with existing work.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3562v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"A comparative study on communication structures of Chinese journals in
  the social sciences"	Ping Zhou	Xinning Su, Loet Leydesdorff	2010-02-18 18:24:06	We argue that the communication structures in the Chinese social sciences have not yet been sufficiently reformed. Citation patterns among Chinese domestic journals in three subject areas -- political science and marxism, library and information science, and economics -- are compared with their counterparts internationally. Like their colleagues in the natural and life sciences, Chinese scholars in the social sciences provide fewer references to journal publications than their international counterparts; like their international colleagues, social scientists provide fewer references than natural sciences. The resulting citation networks, therefore, are sparse. Nevertheless, the citation structures clearly suggest that the Chinese social sciences are far less specialized in terms of disciplinary delineations than their international counterparts. Marxism studies are more established than political science in China. In terms of the impact of the Chinese political system on academic fields, disciplines closely related to the political system are less specialized than those weakly related. In the discussion section, we explore reasons that may cause the current stagnation and provide policy recommendations.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3590v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Science Fiction as a Worldwide Phenomenon: A Study of International
  Creation, Consumption and Dissemination"	Elysia Wells	Aucun	2013-08-06 14:58:25	This paper examines the international nature of science fiction. The focus of this research is to determine whether science fiction is primarily English speaking and Western or global; being created and consumed by people in non-Western, non-English speaking countries? Science fiction's international presence was found in three ways, by network analysis, by examining a online retailer and with a survey. Condor, a program developed by GalaxyAdvisors was used to determine if science fiction is being talked about by non-English speakers. An analysis of the international Amazon.com websites was done to discover if it was being consumed worldwide. A survey was also conducted to see if people had experience with science fiction. All three research methods revealed similar results. Science fiction was found to be international, with science fiction creators originating in different countries and writing in a host of different languages. English and non-English science fiction was being created and consumed all over the world, not just in the English speaking West.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1292v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Development of Computer Science Disciplines - A Social Network Analysis
  Approach"	Manh Cuong Pham	Ralf Klamma, Matthias Jarke	2011-03-10 09:51:19	In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries (DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First, conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third, experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1977v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science Education in the 21st Century	Sun Kwok	Aucun	2018-06-21 02:02:14	The traditional university science curriculum was designed to train specialists in specific disciplines. However, in universities all over the world, science students are going into increasingly diverse careers and the current model does not fit their needs. Advances in technology also make certain modes of learning obsolete. In the last 10 years, the Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong has undertaken major curriculum reforms. A sequence of science foundation courses required of all incoming science students are designed to teach science in an integrated manner, and to emphasize the concepts and utilities, not computational techniques, of mathematics. A number of non-discipline specific common core courses have been developed to broaden students' awareness of the relevance of science to society and the interdisciplinary nature of science. By putting the emphasis on the scientific process rather than the outcome, students are taught how to identify, formulate, and solve diverse problems.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0510-4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Investigating the Intersection of Science Fiction, Human-Computer
  Interaction and Computer Science Research"	Philipp Jordan	Aucun	2018-07-25 09:02:02	This paper outlines ongoing dissertation research located in the intersection of science fiction, human-computer interaction and computer science. Through an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing from fields such as human-computer interaction, film theory and studies of science and technology, qualitative and quantitative content analysis techniques are used to contextually analyze expressions of science fiction in peer-reviewed computer science research repositories, such as the ACM or IEEE Xplore Digital Libraries. This paper concisely summarizes and introduces the relationship of science fiction and computer science research and presents the research questions, aims and implications in addition to prior work and study methodology. In the latter part of this work-in-progress report, preliminary results, current limitations, future work and a post-dissertation trajectory are outlined.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09490v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Philosophy of science viewed through the lense of ""References
  Publication Years spectrosopy"" (RPYS)"	K. Brad Wray	Lutz Bornmann	2014-10-13 12:03:46	We examine the sub-field of philosophy of science using a new method developed in information science, Referenced Publication Years Spectroscopy (RPYS). RPYS allows us to identify peak years in citations in a field, which promises to help scholars identify the key contributions to a field, and revolutionary discoveries in a field. We discovered that philosophy of science, a sub-field in the humanities, differs significantly from other fields examined with this method. Books play a more important role in philosophy of science than in the sciences. Further, Einstein's famous 1905 papers created a citation peak in the philosophy of science literature. But rather than being a contribution to the philosophy of science, their importance lies in the fact that they are revolutionary contributions to physics with important implications for philosophy of science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3461v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Building an Argument for the Use of Science Fiction in HCI Education	Philipp Jordan	Paula Alexandra Silva	2018-11-02 18:24:18	Science fiction literature, comics, cartoons and, in particular, audio-visual materials, such as science fiction movies and shows, can be a valuable addition in Human-computer interaction (HCI) Education. In this paper, we present an overview of research relative to future directions in HCI Education, distinct crossings of science fiction in HCI and Computer Science teaching and the Framework for 21st Century Learning. Next, we provide examples where science fiction can add to the future of HCI Education. In particular, we argue herein first that science fiction, as tangible and intangible cultural artifact, can serve as a trigger for creativity and innovation and thus, support us in exploring the design space. Second, science fiction, as a means to analyze yet-to-come HCI technologies, can assist us in developing an open-minded and reflective dialogue about technological futures, thus creating a singular base for critical thinking and problem solving. Provided that one is cognizant of its potential and limitations, we reason that science fiction can be a meaningful extension of selected aspects of HCI curricula and research.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01033v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science Under Attack	Nicholas Maxwell	Aucun	2019-12-12 12:48:05	Some attack scientific rationality, others defend it, but both miss the point. What both parties take to be scientific rationality is actually a species of irrationality masquerading as scientific rationality. The current orthodox conception of science, taken for granted by scientists and non-scientists alike, is irrational because it suppresses problematic assumptions, inherent in the aims of science, having to do with metaphysics, values, and political and social issues. We urgently need a more rigorous conception of science to be adopted and implemented that honestly acknowledges the problematic character of the aims of science, and seeks to improve them as science proceeds.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10416v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A tale of two databases: The use of Web of Science and Scopus in
  academic papers"	Junwen Zhu	Weishu Liu	2020-02-07 03:38:39	Web of Science and Scopus are two world-leading and competing citation databases. By using the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index, this paper conducts a comparative, dynamic, and empirical study focusing on the use of Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus in academic papers published during 2004 and 2018. This brief communication reveals that although both Web of Science and Scopus are increasingly used in academic papers, Scopus as a new-comer is really challenging the dominating role of WoS. Researchers from more and more countries/regions and knowledge domains are involved in the use of these two databases. Even though the main producers of related papers are developed economies, some developing economies such as China, Brazil and Iran also act important roles but with different patterns in the use of these two databases. Both two databases are widely used in meta-analysis related studies especially for researchers in China. Health/medical science related domains and the traditional Information Science & Library Science field stand out in the use of citation databases.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02608v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Trust in Data Science: Collaboration, Translation, and Accountability in
  Corporate Data Science Projects"	Samir Passi	Steven J. Jackson	2020-02-09 15:50:50	The trustworthiness of data science systems in applied and real-world settings emerges from the resolution of specific tensions through situated, pragmatic, and ongoing forms of work. Drawing on research in CSCW, critical data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers, (counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science research and practice, both within and beyond CSCW.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3274405	cs	arxiv					0.0

History Of Rigor: A Review Of 20th Century Science Education	Jason Garver	Aucun	2020-12-12 20:16:27	"""Rigor"" is an often sought after but ill-defined concept in education. This work reviews several models of rigor from current literature before proposing a tool which is used to analyze science education throughout history. The 20\textsuperscript{th} century science education in the United States was subject to changing sociopolitical motivations about the use of science both in general and for students. These factors as well as developments in theory of learning and broad education reforms had changing affects on the level of rigor in science education. This work analyzes the theoretical level of rigor of science education in the US based on two main motivating factors for science education; science as a social endeavor and science as a discipline, throughout the 20\textsuperscript{th} century."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06903v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Opinionated practices for teaching reproducibility: motivation, guided
  instruction and practice"	Joel Ostblom	Tiffany Timbers	2021-09-17 19:15:41	In the data science courses at the University of British Columbia, we define data science as the study, development and practice of reproducible and auditable processes to obtain insight from data. While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we deeply motivate, effectively guide and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2022.2074922	cs	arxiv					0.0

"How sustainable is ""common"" data science in terms of power consumption?"	Bjorge Meulemeester	David Martens	2022-07-05 10:15:22	"Continuous developments in data science have brought forth an exponential increase in complexity of machine learning models. Additionally, data scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market, academic environments and even as a hobby. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular ""common"" data science to the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks will be measured and compared to: large-scale ""advanced"" data science, common computer-related tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. This is done by converting the measurements to the equivalent unit of ""km driven by car"". Our main findings are: ""common"" data science consumes $2.57$ more power than regular computer usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as lighting or heating; large-scale data science consumes substantially more power than common data science."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01934v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
How Do Data Science Workers Communicate Intermediate Results?	Rock Yuren Pang	Ruotong Wang, Joely Nelson, Leilani Battle	2022-10-07 03:28:33	Data science workers increasingly collaborate on large-scale projects before communicating insights to a broader audience in the form of visualization. While prior work has modeled how data science teams, oftentimes with distinct roles and work processes, communicate knowledge to outside stakeholders, we have little knowledge of how data science workers communicate intermediately before delivering the final products. In this work, we contribute a nuanced description of the intermediate communication process within data science teams. By analyzing interview data with 8 self-identified data science workers, we characterized the data science intermediate communication process with four factors, including the types of audience, communication goals, shared artifacts, and mode of communication. We also identified overarching challenges in the current communication process. We also discussed design implications that might inform better tools that facilitate intermediate communication within data science teams.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03305v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Open Science in Lattice Gauge Theory community	Andreas Athenodorou	Ed Bennett, Julian Lenz, Elli Papadopoullou	2022-12-09 13:46:20	Open science aims to make scientific research processes, tools and results accessible to all scientific communities, creating trust in science and enabling digital competences to be realized in research, leading to increased innovation. It provides standard and transparent pathways to conducting research and fosters best practices for collecting, analysing, preserving, sharing and reusing data, software, workflows and other outputs through collaborative networks. Open Science appears to be becoming the norm with its applications spanning throughout the whole research cycle of a project. The importance of making Open Science a reality is nowadays reflected in funding policies, research infrastructure and politics. In these proceedings we present the basic Open Science principles explaining briefly best practices for materialising Open Science. Subsequently, we present the results of the landscaping survey of Open Science in the Lattice Gauge Theories community. Finally, we provide directions in which the Lattice Gauge Theory community could move in order to enhance Openness and FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) in Science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04853v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Network Analysis of the iNaturalist Citizen Science Community	Yu Lu Liu	Thomas Jiralerspong	2023-10-16 00:41:13	In recent years, citizen science has become a larger and larger part of the scientific community. Its ability to crowd source data and expertise from thousands of citizen scientists makes it invaluable. Despite the field's growing popularity, the interactions and structure of citizen science projects are still poorly understood and under analyzed. We use the iNaturalist citizen science platform as a case study to analyze the structure of citizen science projects. We frame the data from iNaturalist as a bipartite network and use visualizations as well as established network science techniques to gain insights into the structure and interactions between users in citizen science projects. Finally, we propose a novel unique benchmark for network science research by using the iNaturalist data to create a network which has an unusual structure relative to other common benchmark networks. We demonstrate using a link prediction task that this network can be used to gain novel insights into a variety of network science methods.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10693v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The 4+1 Model of Data Science	Rafael C. Alvarado	Aucun	2023-11-13 12:12:32	Data Science is a complex and evolving field, but most agree that it can be defined as a combination of expertise drawn from three broad areascomputer science and technology, math and statistics, and domain knowledge -- with the purpose of extracting knowledge and value from data. Beyond this, the field is often defined as a series of practical activities ranging from the cleaning and wrangling of data, to its analysis and use to infer models, to the visual and rhetorical representation of results to stakeholders and decision-makers. This essay proposes a model of data science that goes beyond laundry-list definitions to get at the specific nature of data science and help distinguish it from adjacent fields such as computer science and statistics. We define data science as an interdisciplinary field comprising four broad areas of expertise: value, design, systems, and analytics. A fifth area, practice, integrates the other four in specific contexts of domain knowledge. We call this the 4+1 model of data science. Together, these areas belong to every data science project, even if they are often unconnected and siloed in the academy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07631v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Has Science Established that the Cosmos is Physically Comprehensible?	Nicholas Maxwell	Aucun	2012-10-05 13:14:28	Most scientists would hold that science has not established that the cosmos is physically comprehensible - i.e. such that there is some as-yet undiscovered true physical theory of everything that is unified. This is an empirically untestable thesis and thus lies beyond the scope of science. However, this argument presupposes a conception of science which holds that in science theories are accepted solely on the basis of evidence. But this conception of science is untenable. Any fundamental physical theory, in order to be accepted as a part of theoretical scientific knowledge, must be (1) sufficiently empirically successful, and (2) sufficiently unified. Given any accepted theory of physics, endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals can always be concocted - disunified because they assert that different dynamical laws govern the diverse phenomena to which the theory applies. These disunified rivals are not considered for a moment in physics, despite their greater empirical success. This persistent rejection of empirically more successful but disunified rival theories means, I argue, that a big, highly problematic, implicit assumption is made by science about the cosmos, to the effect, at least, that the cosmos is such that all seriously disunified theories are false. Once this point is recognized, it becomes clear, I argue, that we need a new conception of science which holds that science makes a hierarchy of assumptions about the cosmos, these assumptions becoming less and less substantial as one goes up the hierarchy. One of these assumptions is that the cosmos is physically comprehensible. Hence the conclusion: improve our ideas about the nature of science and it becomes apparent that science has established that the cosmos is physically comprehensible.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1747v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Growth rates of modern science: A bibliometric analysis based on the
  number of publications and cited references"	Lutz Bornmann	Ruediger Mutz	2014-02-19 08:00:26	Many studies in information science have looked at the growth of science. In this study, we re-examine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (i) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (ii) analyse it across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data are analysed with an advanced statistical technique - segmented regression analysis - which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (1) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (2) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We have looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9% to 2012.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4578v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Do We Need a Scientific Revolution?	Nicholas Maxwell	Aucun	2011-03-10 09:43:05	Many see modern science as having serious defects, intellectual, social, moral. Few see this as having anything to do with the philosophy of science. I argue that many diverse ills of modern science are a consequence of the fact that the scientific community has long accepted, and sought to implement, a bad philosophy of science, which I call standard empiricism. This holds that the basic intellectual aim is truth, the basic method being impartial assessment of claims to knowledge with respect to evidence. Standard empiricism is, however, untenable. Furthermore, the attempt to put it into scientific practice has many damaging consequences for science. The scientific community urgently needs to bring about a revolution in both the conception of science, and science itself. It needs to be acknowledged that the actual aims of science make metaphysical, value and political assumptions and are, as a result, deeply problematic. Science needs to try to improve its aims and methods as it proceeds. Standard empiricism needs to be rejected, and the more rigorous philosophy of science of aim-oriented empiricism needs to be adopted and explicitly implemented in scientific practice instead. The outcome would be the emergence of a new kind of science, of greater value in both intellectual and humanitarian terms.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1974v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A large-scale comparative analysis of Coding Standard conformance in
  Open-Source Data Science projects"	Andrew J. Simmons	Scott Barnett, Jessica Rivera-Villicana, Akshat Bajaj, Rajesh Vasa	2020-07-17 13:45:00	Background: Meeting the growing industry demand for Data Science requires cross-disciplinary teams that can translate machine learning research into production-ready code. Software engineering teams value adherence to coding standards as an indication of code readability, maintainability, and developer expertise. However, there are no large-scale empirical studies of coding standards focused specifically on Data Science projects. Aims: This study investigates the extent to which Data Science projects follow code standards. In particular, which standards are followed, which are ignored, and how does this differ to traditional software projects? Method: We compare a corpus of 1048 Open-Source Data Science projects to a reference group of 1099 non-Data Science projects with a similar level of quality and maturity. Results: Data Science projects suffer from a significantly higher rate of functions that use an excessive numbers of parameters and local variables. Data Science projects also follow different variable naming conventions to non-Data Science projects. Conclusions: The differences indicate that Data Science codebases are distinct from traditional software codebases and do not follow traditional software engineering conventions. Our conjecture is that this may be because traditional software engineering conventions are inappropriate in the context of Data Science projects.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3382494.3410680	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Growth rates of modern science: A latent piecewise growth curve approach
  to model publication numbers from established and new literature databases"	Lutz Bornmann	Robin Haunschild, Ruediger Mutz	2020-12-14 16:25:01	Growth of science is a prevalent issue in science of science studies. In recent years, two new bibliographic databases have been introduced which can be used to study growth processes in science from centuries back: Dimensions from Digital Science and Microsoft Academic. In this study, we used publication data from these new databases and added publication data from two established databases (Web of Science from Clarivate Analytics and Scopus from Elsevier) to investigate scientific growth processes from the beginning of the modern science system until today. We estimated regression models that included simultaneously the publication counts from the four databases. The results of the unrestricted growth of science calculations show that the overall growth rate amounts to 4.10% with a doubling time of 17.3 years. As the comparison of various segmented regression models in the current study revealed, the model with five segments fits the publication data best. We demonstrated that these segments with different growth rates can be interpreted very well, since they are related to either phases of economic (e.g., industrialization) and / or political developments (e.g., Second World War). In this study, we additionally analyzed scientific growth in two broad fields (Physical and Technical Sciences as well as Life Sciences) and the relationship of scientific and economic growth in UK. The comparison between the two fields revealed only slight differences. The comparison of the British economic and scientific growth rates showed that the economic growth rate is slightly lower than the scientific growth rate.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07675v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Using multilevel modeling to evaluate science literacy and technology
  course of the Indonesian non-science students"	Bayu Setiaji	Purwoko Haryadi Santoso, Khafidh Nur Aziz, Heri Retnawati, Moh Khairudin	2023-04-13 19:06:24	Science literacy is being fostered by science education community including the Indonesian education system. Science literacy and technology course has been designed and implemented to strengthen the national initiative empowering scientifically literate Indonesian society. This paper is intended to evaluate to what degree this course can be performed by non-science undergraduate students (N = 160) considering the nested structure of students' department and faculty setting. Multilevel modeling thus was employed to conduct the analysis dealing with this nature. The first level analysis involved students' performance and affective attribute measured using demonstrated science literacy assessment (SLA-D) and motivational beliefs (SLA-MB) respectively. The subsequent level analysis comprised demographic factors gathered from institutional record. Findings demonstrated that the impact of demographic factor to the students' performance on science literacy was not substantial. Different setting of students' department and faculty level drove the association between affective factor and learning process toward science literacy course substantially. Multilevel approach has controlled the equitable student assessment within the nature of students' data structure. This paper suggests many implications to open ideas regarding educational data analysis and to examine the effectiveness of science literacy course for the higher institution specifically for non-science majors.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06782v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"How Informal Science Education Influences Elementary Students'
  Perceptions of Science and Themselves"	Molly K Finn	Renato Mazzei, Blake Drechsler, Zoie Telkamp, Mihika Rao, Prakamya Agrawal, Anne McAlister	2023-06-09 16:30:36	Underrepresentation in STEM fields starts early, with elementary students already showing differences based on gender and race in their interest in science, belief in their ability to do science, and belief that their personal identity aligns with being a scientist. Here we discuss an out-of-school time astronomy program that focuses on enriching science education in under-served school systems to promote students' excitement about science and help them see scientists as people just like them. Before, after, and throughout the program, we survey students on their perceptions of science, themselves, and their activities. We find that over the course of our program, students become more confident in their science abilities. Student ideas about science remain unchanged, but largely align with Nature of Science ideals. We also find that on days that students report they were creative and asked questions, they were more likely to say they felt like a scientist and were interested in the day's topic. Our results suggest that incorporating creativity and opportunities to ask questions can be just as important as doing experiments for generating interest in and a sense of participating in science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06014v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

  Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index"	Loet Leydesdorff	Aucun	2009-11-13 22:56:15	"The two Journal Citation Reports of the Science Citation Index 2004 and the Social Science Citation Index 2004 were combined in order to analyze and map journals and specialties at the edges and in the overlap between the two databases. For journals which belong to the overlap (e.g., Scientometrics), the merger mainly enriches our insight into the structure which can be obtained from the two databases separately; but in the case of scientific journals which are more marginal in either database, the combination can provide a new perspective on the position and function of these journals (e.g., Environment and Planning B-Planning and Design). The combined database additionally enables us to map citation environments in terms of the various specialties comprehensively. Using the vector-space model, visualizations are provided for specialties that are parts of the overlap (information science, science & technology studies). On the basis of the resulting visualizations, ""betweenness""--a measure from social network analysis--is suggested as an indicator for measuring the interdisciplinarity of journals."	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2723v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Science shops: A kaleidoscope of science-society collaborations in
  Europe"	Loet Leydesdorff	Janelle Ward	2009-11-22 21:17:39	The science-shop model was initiated in the Netherlands in the 1970s. During the 1980s, the model spread throughout Europe, but without much coordination. The crucial idea behind the science shops involves a working relationship between knowledge-producing institutions like universities and citizen groups that need answers to relevant questions. More recently, the European Commission has funded a number of projects for taking stock of the results of science shops. Twenty-one in-depth case studies by seven science shops across Europe enable us to draw some conclusions about the variety of experiences in terms of differences among disciplines, nations, and formats of the historical institutionalization. The functions of science shops in the mediation of normative concerns with analytical perspectives can further be specified.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4289v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Educational asymmetries in the making: Science Fair Competitions as
  Proxies of the Economic Development"	Dejan Vinkovic	Dunja Potocnik	2010-07-14 22:03:48	Croatia does not score well in the human development index, rate of employment, or development of the high tech sector - to mention only a few indicators that hinder good prospects for improvement. Also, Croatian high school students are at the bottom of European rankings on performance in science and mathematics and their interest in career in science is declining. Croatia needs more educated people, especially in the area of science and technology, and this can be achieved only if the youth become interested in science at an early age. Thus, science fair competitions are of an utmost importance for development of Croatia. This paper aims at investigating a relation of the Croatian counties' development index and their students' participation rates in the science fair competitions. This is done by including two development indexes in search for the relation with the counties' participation rates in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics competition, and with a reference to a previous research on astronomy competition. As is revealed, there is a growing trend of interconnection of the development index and participation rates at science competitions in all disciplines.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2443v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Mathematics : The Language of Science	A. N. Mitra	Aucun	2011-11-24 09:30:10	The purpose of this essay is to bring out the unique role of Mathematics in providing a base to the diverse sciences which conform to its rigid structure. Of these the physical and economic sciences are so intimately linked with mathematics, that they have become almost a part of its structure under the generic title of Applied Mathematics. But with the progress of time, more and more branches of Science are getting quantified and coming under its ambit. And once a branch of science gets articulated into a mathematical structure, the process goes beyond mere classification and arrangement, and becomes eligible as a candidate for enjoying its predictive powers! Indeed it is this single property of Mathematics which gives it the capacity to predict the nature of evolution in time of the said branch of science. This has been well verified in the domain of physical sciences, but now even biological sciences are slowly feeling its strength, and the list is expanding.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6560v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Year 3 LUNAR Annual Report to the NASA Lunar Science Institute	Jack Burns	Joseph Lazio	2012-03-04 07:45:28	The Lunar University Network for Astrophysics Research (LUNAR) is a team of researchers and students at leading universities, NASA centers, and federal research laboratories undertaking investigations aimed at using the Moon as a platform for space science. LUNAR research includes Lunar Interior Physics & Gravitation using Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR), Low Frequency Cosmology and Astrophysics (LFCA), Planetary Science and the Lunar Ionosphere, Radio Heliophysics, and Exploration Science. The LUNAR team is exploring technologies that are likely to have a dual purpose, serving both exploration and science. There is a certain degree of commonality in much of LUNAR's research. Specifically, the technology development for a lunar radio telescope involves elements from LFCA, Heliophysics, Exploration Science, and Planetary Science; similarly the drilling technology developed for LLR applies broadly to both Exploration and Lunar Science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3574v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A bird's-eye view of scientific trading: Dependency relations among
  fields of science"	Erjia Yan	Ying Ding, Blaise Cronin, Loet Leydesdorff	2012-11-25 23:22:05	We use a trading metaphor to study knowledge transfer in the sciences as well as the social sciences. The metaphor comprises four dimensions: (a) Discipline Self-dependence, (b) Knowledge Exports/Imports, (c) Scientific Trading Dynamics, and (d) Scientific Trading Impact. This framework is applied to a dataset of 221 Web of Science subject categories. We find that: (i) the Scientific Trading Impact and Dynamics of Materials Science And Transportation Science have increased; (ii) Biomedical Disciplines, Physics, And Mathematics are significant knowledge exporters, as is Statistics & Probability; (iii) in the social sciences, Economics, Business, Psychology, Management, And Sociology are important knowledge exporters; (iv) Discipline Self-dependence is associated with specialized domains which have ties to professional practice (e.g., Law, Ophthalmology, Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine, Psychology, Psychoanalysis, Veterinary Sciences, And Nursing).	http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5820v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science 3.0: Corrections to the Science 2.0 paradigm	Vladimir B. Teif	Aucun	2013-01-11 15:40:35	The concept of Science 2.0 was introduced almost a decade ago to describe the new generation of online-based tools for researchers allowing easier data sharing, collaboration and publishing. Although technically sound, the concept still does not work as expected. Here we provide a systematic line of arguments to modify the concept of Science 2.0, making it more consistent with the spirit and traditions of science and Internet. Our first correction to the Science 2.0 paradigm concerns the open-access publication models charging fees to the authors. As discussed elsewhere, we show that the monopoly of such publishing models increases biases and inequalities in the representation of scientific ideas based on the author's income. Our second correction concerns post-publication comments online, which are all essentially non-anonymous in the current Science 2.0 paradigm. We conclude that scientific post-publication discussions require special anonymization systems. We further analyze the reasons of the failure of the current post-publication peer-review models and suggest what needs to be changed in Science 3.0 to convert Internet into a large journal club.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2522v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Writing Science Fiction Stories to Motivate Analysis of Journal Articles	F. J. Kontur	Aucun	2014-03-10 23:19:06	For many students, college physics courses have little or even negative impact on their beliefs about the connection between physics and the everyday world. One way to help students see this connection is to incorporate analysis of science articles into the course. For introductory courses, one might have students discuss newspaper articles related to science or articles from popular science magazines while articles from peer-reviewed journals might be more appropriate for honors-level or upper-division courses. In this work, I describe a project done in a two-semester upper-division electricity and magnetism course at the United States Air Force Academy in which students were required to use the science from a peer-reviewed journal article to write a science fiction story. Although others have utilized science fiction stories in physics courses, this is the first article to describe a project in which students write their own science fiction stories in a physics course.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2435v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Complex Workflow Management and Integration of Distributed Computing
  Resources by Science Gateway Portal for Molecular Dynamics Simulations in
  Materials Science"	Yuri Gordienko	Lev Bekenov, Olexandr Gatsenko, Elena Zasimchuk, Valentin Tatarenko	2014-04-22 11:34:04	"The ""IMP Science Gateway Portal"" (http://scigate.imp.kiev.ua) for complex workflow management and integration of distributed computing resources (like clusters, service grids, desktop grids, clouds) is presented. It is created on the basis of WS-PGRADE and gUSE technologies, where WS-PGRADE is designed for science workflow operation and gUSE - for smooth integration of available resources for parallel and distributed computing in various heterogeneous distributed computing infrastructures (DCI). The typical scientific workflow with possible scenarios of its preparation and usage is considered. Several typical science applications (scientific workflows) are considered for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex behavior of various nanostructures (nanoindentation of graphene layers, defect system relaxation in metal nanocrystals, thermal stability of boron nitride nanotubes, etc.). The advantages and drawbacks of the solution are shortly analyzed in the context of its practical applications for MD simulations in materials science, physics and nanotechnologies with available heterogeneous DCIs."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5458v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"""Bring it on"": Explaining persistence in science at the intersection of
  identity and epistemology"	Luke D. Conlin	Jennifer Richards, Ayush Gupta, Andrew Elby	2015-02-16 04:45:22	"Research has documented a sharp decline in students' interest and persistence in science, starting in middle school, particularly among students from underrepresented populations. In working to address this problem, we can learn a great deal from positive examples of students getting excited about science, especially students who were previously disengaged. In this paper, we present a case study of Estevan, an 8th grade student who came into Ms. K's science class with a reputation as a potential ""problem student,"" but left as a leader of the class, even making plans to pursue a career in science. Through analysis of interviews and classroom interactions, we show how Estevan's love of science can be partially explained by an alignment between his identity as a lover of challenges and his epistemology of science as involving the challenge of figuring things out for yourself. This alignment was possible in part because it was supported by his caring teacher, who attended to his ideas and constantly challenged him and the rest of her students to figure things out for themselves instead of just ""giving them the answers."""	http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04421v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science of Cyber Security as a System of Models and Problems	Alexander Kott	Aucun	2015-11-29 23:54:03	"Terms like ""Science of Cyber"" or ""Cyber Science"" have been appearing in literature with growing frequency, and influential organizations initiated research initiatives toward developing such a science even though it is not clearly defined. We propose to define the domain of the science of cyber security by noting the most salient artifact within cyber security -- malicious software -- and defining the domain as comprised of phenomena that involve malicious software (as well as legitimate software and protocols used maliciously) used to compel a computing device or a network of computing devices to perform actions desired by the perpetrator of malicious software (the attacker) and generally contrary to the intent (the policy) of the legitimate owner or operator (the defender) of the computing device(s). We further define the science of cyber security as the study of relations -- preferably expressed as theoretically-grounded models -- between attributes, structures and dynamics of: violations of cyber security policy; the network of computing devices under attack; the defenders' tools and techniques; and the attackers' tools and techniques where malicious software plays the central role. We offer a simple formalism of these key objects within cyber science and systematically derive a classification of primary problem classes within cyber science."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00407v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Scientific progress despite irreproducibility: A seeming paradox	Richard M. Shiffrin	Katy Borner, Stephen M. Stigler	2017-10-05 10:10:56	It appears paradoxical that science is producing outstanding new results and theories at a rapid rate at the same time that researchers are identifying serious problems in the practice of science that cause many reports to be irreproducible and invalid. Certainly the practice of science needs to be improved and scientists are now pursuing this goal. However, in this perspective we argue that this seeming paradox is not new, has always been part of the way science works, and likely will remain so. We first introduce the paradox. We then review a wide range of challenges that appear to make scientific success difficult. Next, we describe the factors that make science work-in the past, present, and presumably also in the future. We then suggest that remedies for the present practice of science need to be applied selectively so as not to slow progress, and illustrate with a few examples. We conclude with arguments that communication of science needs to emphasize not just problems but the enormous successes and benefits that science has brought and is now bringing to all elements of modern society.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1711786114	cs	arxiv					0.0

Citizen Science: An Information Quality Research Frontier	Roman Lukyanenko	Andrea Wiggins, Holly K. Rosser	2019-05-20 18:39:57	The rapid proliferation of online content producing and sharing technologies resulted in an explosion of user-generated content (UGC), which now extends to scientific data. Citizen science, in which ordinary people contribute information for scientific research, epitomizes UGC. Citizen science projects are typically open to everyone, engage diverse audiences, and challenge ordinary people to produce data of highest quality to be usable in science. This also makes citizen science a very exciting area to study both traditional and innovative approaches to information quality management. With this paper we position citizen science as a leading information quality research frontier. We also show how citizen science opens a unique opportunity for the information systems community to contribute to a broad range of disciplines in natural and social sciences and humanities.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08289v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science Quality and the Value of Inventions	Felix Poege	Dietmar Harhoff, Fabian Gaessler, Stefano Baruffaldi	2019-03-12 16:19:24	"Despite decades of research, the relationship between the quality of science and the value of inventions has remained unclear. We present the result of a large-scale matching exercise between 4.8 million patent families and 43 million publication records. We find a strong positive relationship between quality of scientific contributions referenced in patents and the value of the respective inventions. We rank patents by the quality of the science they are linked to. Strikingly, high-rank patents are twice as valuable as low-rank patents, which in turn are about as valuable as patents without direct science link. We show this core result for various science quality and patent value measures. The effect of science quality on patent value remains relevant even when science is linked indirectly through other patents. Our findings imply that what is considered ""excellent"" within the science sector also leads to outstanding outcomes in the technological or commercial realm."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay7323	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Addressing Hate Speech with Data Science: An Overview from Computer
  Science Perspective"	Ivan Srba	Gabriele Lenzini, Matus Pikuliak, Samuel Pecar	2021-03-18 19:19:44	From a computer science perspective, addressing on-line hate speech is a challenging task that is attracting the attention of both industry (mainly social media platform owners) and academia. In this chapter, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art data-science approaches - how they define hate speech, which tasks they solve to mitigate the phenomenon, and how they address these tasks. We limit our investigation mostly to (semi-)automatic detection of hate speech, which is the task that the majority of existing computer science works focus on. Finally, we summarize the challenges and the open problems in the current data-science research and the future directions in this field. Our aim is to prepare an easily understandable report, capable to promote the multidisciplinary character of hate speech research. Researchers from other domains (e.g., psychology and sociology) can thus take advantage of the knowledge achieved in the computer science domain but also contribute back and help improve how computer science is addressing that urgent and socially relevant issue which is the prevalence of hate speech in social media.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-31793-5_14	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Square Kilometre Array Science Data Challenge 1	Anna Bonaldi	Robert Braun	2018-11-26 15:33:19	The Square Kilometre Array (SKA, https://skatelescope.org) will be the world's largest radio telescope. SKA Science Data Challenges will be regularly issued to the community as part of the science preparatory activities. The purpose of these challenges is to inform the development of the data reduction workflows, to allow the science community to get familiar with the standard products the SKA will deliver, and optimise their analyses to extract science from them. These challenges may consist of real data from currently operating radio facilities or of simulated SKA data. The purpose of this document is to provide information on how the SKA Science data challenge #1 (SDC1) has been produced and to set the challenge for the community.

Data-driven materials science: status, challenges and perspectives	Lauri Himanen	Amber Geurts, Adam S. Foster, Patrick Rinke	2019-07-12 09:44:01	Data-driven science is heralded as a new paradigm in materials science. In this field, data is the new resource, and knowledge is extracted from materials data sets that are too big or complex for traditional human reasoning - typically with the intent to discover new or improved materials or materials phenomena. Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development. Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, we discuss the historical development and current state of data-driven materials science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid expansion of materials data infrastructures. We also review key successes and challenges so far, providing a perspective on the future development of the field.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.201900808	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Trajectory Design for the ESA LISA Mission	Waldemar Martens	Eric Joffre	2021-01-08 14:42:08	The three Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) spacecraft are going to be placed in a triangular formation in an Earth-trailing or Earth-leading orbit. They will be launched together on a single rocket and transferred to that science orbit using Solar Electric Propulsion. Since the transfer $\Delta v$ depends on the chosen science orbit, both transfer and science orbit have been optimised together. For a thrust level of 90 mN, an allocation of 1092 m/s per spacecraft is sufficient for an all-year launch in 2034. For every launch month a dedicated science orbit is designed with a corner angle variation of close to $60^\circ \pm 1.0^\circ$ and an arm length rate of maximum 10 m/s. Moreover, a detailed navigation analysis of the science orbit insertion and the impact on insertion errors on the constellation stability has been conducted. The analysis shows that Range/Doppler measurements together with a series of correction manoeuvres at the beginning of the science orbit phase can reduce insertion dispersions to a level where corner angle variations remain at about $60^\circ \pm 1.1^\circ$ at $99\%$ C.L.. However, the situation can become significantly worse if the self-gravity accelerations acting during the science orbit phase are not sufficiently characterised prior to science orbit insertion.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40295-021-00263-2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
How do Data Science Workers Collaborate? Roles, Workflows, and Tools	Amy X. Zhang	Michael Muller, Dakuo Wang	2020-01-18 15:11:56	Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06684v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Pot, kettle: Nonliteral titles aren't (natural) science	Mike Thelwall	Aucun	2020-06-14 09:32:13	Researchers may be tempted to attract attention through poetic titles for their publications, but would this be mistaken in some fields? Whilst poetic titles are known to be common in medicine, it is not clear whether the practice is widespread elsewhere. This article investigates the prevalence of poetic expressions in journal article titles 1996-2019 in 3.3 million articles from all 27 Scopus broad fields. Expressions were identified by manually checking all phrases with at least 5 words that occurred at least 25 times, finding 149 stock phrases, idioms, sayings, literary allusions, film names and song titles or lyrics. The expressions found are most common in the social sciences and the humanities. They are also relatively common in medicine, but almost absent from engineering and the natural and formal sciences. The differences may reflect the less hierarchical and more varied nature of the social sciences and humanities, where interesting titles may attract an audience. In engineering, natural science and formal science fields, authors should take extra care with poetic expressions, in case their choice is judged inappropriate. This includes interdisciplinary research overlapping these areas. Conversely, reviewers of interdisciplinary research involving the social sciences should be more tolerant of poetic license.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07849v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Lesson from the James Webb Space Telescope: Early Engagement with
  Future Astrophysics Great Observatories Maximizes their Solar System Science"	Heidi B. Hammel	Stefanie N. Milam	2020-07-16 20:36:24	Astrophysics facilities have been of tremendous importance for planetary science. The flagship space observatory Hubble Space Telescope has produced ground-breaking Solar System science, but when launched it did not even have the capability to track moving targets. The next astrophysics flagship mission, the James Webb Space Telescope, included Solar System scientists in its science team from the earliest days, with the result that Webb will launch with a diverse program and capabilities for Solar System exploration. The New Great Observatories, as well as future ground-based facilities, offer the opportunity for a robust suite of observations that will complement, enhance, and enable future Solar System exploration. We encourage the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey to overtly acknowledge the prospects for excellent Solar System science with the next generation of astrophysics facilities. We hope the Planetary Decadal will further encourage these missions to continue to formally involve Solar System scientists in the science working groups and development teams.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08618v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Right Tools for the Job: The Case for Spatial Science Tool-Building	Geoff Boeing	Aucun	2020-08-12 20:15:39	This paper was presented as the 8th annual Transactions in GIS plenary address at the American Association of Geographers annual meeting in Washington, DC. The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze nonplanar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This paper reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open-source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools. The paper concludes with paths forward, emphasizing open-source software and reusable computational data science beyond mere reproducibility and replicability.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12678	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Review into Data Science and Its Approaches in Mechanical Engineering	Ashkan Yousefi Zadeh	Meysam Shahbazy	2020-12-30 23:05:29	Nowadays it is inevitable to use intelligent systems to improve the performance and optimization of different components of devices or factories. Furthermore, it's so essential to have appropriate predictions to make better decisions in businesses, medical studies, and engineering studies, etc. One of the newest and most widely used of these methods is a field called Data Science that all of the scientists, engineers, and factories need to learn and use in their careers. This article briefly introduced data science and reviewed its methods, especially it's usages in mechanical engineering and challenges and ways of developing data science in mechanical engineering. In the introduction, different definitions of data science and its background in technology reviewed. In the following, data science methodology which is the process that a data scientist needs to do in its works been discussed. Further, some researches in the mechanical engineering area that used data science methods in their studies, are reviewed. Eventually, it has been discussed according to the subjects that have been reviewed in the article, why it is necessary to use data science in mechanical engineering researches and projects.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15358v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Differences in the attitudes and beliefs about science of students in
  the physics-mathematics and life sciences areas and their impact on teaching"	Alvaro Suarez	Daniel Baccino, Martin Monteiro, Arturo C. Marti	2022-02-23 18:39:51	For this study, we compared the attitudes and beliefs about science of physical science (physics and mathematics) and life science (biochemistry and biology) students at the beginning of their university degrees using the CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) tool. It is worth noting that both groups of students received similar physics courses during their high-school education. Through a detailed analysis of the different categories of the test, we examined the differences in performance in each of the areas that make up the questionnaire. Among other aspects, we found that a considerable percentage of life science students (higher than that of physical science students) adopted a novice type of behavior in problem solving. Finally, we discussed the possible causes of the differences found and their implications for teaching.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11680v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Crypto Makes AI Evolve	Behrouz Zolfaghari	Elnaz Rabieinejad, Abbas Yazdinejad, Reza M. Parizi, Ali Dehghantanha	2022-06-25 15:04:47	Adopting cryptography has given rise to a significant evolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper studies the path and stages of this evolution. We start with reviewing existing relevant surveys, noting their shortcomings, especially the lack of a close look at the evolution process and solid future roadmap. These shortcomings justify the work of this paper. Next, we identify, define and discuss five consequent stages in the evolution path, including Crypto-Sensitive AI, Crypto-Adapted AI, Crypto-Friendly AI, Crypto-Enabled AI, Crypto-Protected AI. Then, we establish a future roadmap for further research in this area, focusing on the role of quantum-inspired and bio-inspired AI.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12669v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Glimpse of International Cooperation in Astrophysical Sciences in
  India"	Ram Sagar	Aucun	2023-04-12 05:51:35	Astronomy and Astrophysics is an observational science dealing with celestial objects. Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) is one of the premier institutions in astronomy and astrophysics and has contributed significantly in this field. No doubt, India is a part of several mega-science projects in the domain of Astronomy and Astrophysics, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT); Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) projects. Growing engagement of India with mega-science projects has brought a positive impact on its science and technology landscape. A few such collaborations are mentioned to demonstrate that international cooperation are necessary in the field of Astrophysical sciences.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05626v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Towards Human-AI Collaborative Urban Science Research Enabled by
  Pre-trained Large Language Models"	Jiayi Fu	Haoying Han, Xing Su, Chao Fan	2023-05-19 04:04:54	Pre-trained large language models (PLMs) have the potential to support urban science research through content creation, information extraction, assisted programming, text classification, and other technical advances. In this research, we explored the opportunities, challenges, and prospects of PLMs in urban science research. Specifically, we discussed potential applications of PLMs to urban institution, urban space, urban information, and citizen behaviors research through seven examples using ChatGPT. We also examined the challenges of PLMs in urban science research from both technical and social perspectives. The prospects of the application of PLMs in urban science research were then proposed. We found that PLMs can effectively aid in understanding complex concepts in urban science, facilitate urban spatial form identification, assist in disaster monitoring, and sense public sentiment. At the same time, however, the applications of PLMs in urban science research face evident threats, such as technical limitations, security, privacy, and social bias. The development of fundamental models based on domain knowledge and human-AI collaboration may help improve PLMs to support urban science research in future.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11418v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Big Science and Science Education: Steps towards an Authentic
  Partnership"	Stephen M. Pompea	Pedro Russo	2023-06-26 09:56:07	Big science projects and facilities can move towards a less self-centered frame of reference as they strive to better identify and serve educational audiences. By doing this, their science education efforts will be more productive in general, and their service to local schools will be more effective. By developing an enlarged awareness of local educational needs, they will become better stewards and partners in their roles in the science education system. They will also become more valued and trustworthy neighbours to their local and cultural communities. We propose a practical way for large science organisations to organise their budgets and their allocation of staff time to greatly increase the effectiveness of their organisation in its contribution to local science education.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14554v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Art of Planetary Science: Art as a Tool for Scientific Inquiry and
  Public Discourse around Space Exploration"	Jamie L. Molaro	Aucun	2023-08-15 07:15:11	Art can be a powerful tool in science engagement efforts to help facilitate learning and public discourse around space and space exploration. The Art of Planetary Science is an annual exhibition combining science and art which aims to help people to connect more meaningfully to science outside of traditional education models. Works solicited from scientists and from the public explore the beauty of the universe, as well as communicate and abstract scientific concepts from an artistic framework. These events offer the public a unique perspective on science and an opportunity to participate in dialogue around how and why we explore space. As an extension of the exhibition, a series of workshops for artists and educators focuses on techniques in creating science-driven art and how it can be used as a tool for scientific inquiry. We will discuss our success with these efforts and the important role that art can play in shaping the evolving narrative of humanity's relationship to space.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06552v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Tarski's influence on computer science	Solomon Feferman	Aucun	2006-08-15 16:40:24	The influence of Alfred Tarski on computer science was indirect but significant in a number of directions and was in certain respects fundamental. Here surveyed is the work of Tarski on the decision procedure for algebra and geometry, the method of elimination of quantifiers, the semantics of formal languages, modeltheoretic preservation theorems, and algebraic logic; various connections of each with computer science are taken up.	http://dx.doi.org/10.2168/LMCS-2(3:6)2006	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Comments Regarding ""On the Nature of Science"""	Amy Courtney	Michael Courtney	2008-12-29 16:04:46	An attempt to redefine science in the 21st century (BK Jennings, On the Nature of Science, Physics in Canada, 63(7) 2007) has abandoned traditional notions of natural law and objective reality, blurred the distinctions between natural science and natural history, elevated Occam's razor from an epistemological preference to a scientific principle, and elevated peer-review and experimental care as equals with repeatable experiment as arbiters of scientific validity. Our comments review the long-established axioms of the scientific method, remind readers of the distinctions between science and history, disprove the generality of Occam's razor by counter example, and highlight the risks of accepting additional scientific arbiters as equal to repeatable experiment.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4932v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Complexity science and intentional systems	Loet Leydesdorff	Aucun	2009-11-07 19:12:07	"In their position paper entitled ""Towards a new, complexity science of learning and education"", Jorg et al. (2007) argue that educational research is in crisis. In their opinion, the transdisciplinary and interdiscursive approach of complexity science with its orientation towards self-organization, emergence, and potentiality provides new modes of inquiry, a new lexicon and assessment practices that can be used to overcome the current crisis. In this contribution, I elaborate on how complexity science can further be developed for understanding the dynamics of intentions and the communication of meaning as these are central to the social-scientific enterprise."	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1449v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Unity, Disunity and Pluralism in Science	David A. Edwards	Stephen Wilcox	2011-10-29 18:27:43	We discuss the problems of consensus and unity in science. The natural sciences seem to contrast with many other areas of endeavor in that a high level of consensus seems to exist in them. However, a careful analysis of the structure of particular physical theories,such as those concerned with electrons, shows that there is great heterogeneity of both theory and methodology. We argue that the natural science community tends to be tolerant of diversity. We contrast this tolerance among natural scientists with the more overt disagreement occurring in the social sciences and humanities. Our central theme is that many intellectual problems arise from straining too hard to make a successful perspective into a total worldview.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6545v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Using Quantum Computers to Learn Physics	Nathan Wiebe	Aucun	2014-01-18 01:46:52	Since its inception at the beginning of the twentieth century, quantum mechanics has challenged our conceptions of how the universe ought to work; however, the equations of quantum mechanics can be too computationally difficult to solve using existing computers for even modestly large systems. Here I will show that quantum computers can sometimes be used to address such problems and that quantum computer science can assign formal complexities to learning facts about nature. Hence, computer science should not only be regarded as an applied science; it is also of central importance to the foundations of science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4507v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A new generation of science overlay maps with an application to the
  history of biosystematics"	Sandor Soos	Aucun	2015-04-22 14:17:38	The paper proposes a text-mining based analytical framework aiming at the cognitive organization of complex scientific discourses. The approach is based on models recently developed in science mapping, being a generalization of the so-called Science Overlay Mapping methodology, referred to as Topic Overlay Mapping (TOM). It is shown that via applications of TOM in visualization, document clustering, time series analysis etc. the in-depth exploration and even the measurement of cognitive complexity and its dynamics is feasible for scientific domains. As a use case, an empirical study is presented into the discovery of a long-standing complex, interdisciplinary discourse, the debate on the species concept in biosystematics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05816v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Machine learning application in the life time of materials	Xiaojiao Yu	Aucun	2017-07-16 05:58:40	Materials design and development typically takes several decades from the initial discovery to commercialization with the traditional trial and error development approach. With the accumulation of data from both experimental and computational results, data based machine learning becomes an emerging field in materials discovery, design and property prediction. This manuscript reviews the history of materials science as a disciplinary the most common machine learning method used in materials science, and specifically how they are used in materials discovery, design, synthesis and even failure detection and analysis after materials are deployed in real application. Finally, the limitations of machine learning for application in materials science and challenges in this emerging field is discussed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04826v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

At Aalto University, Finland, we have taken first steps to bring educational data science as a part of daily operations of Management Information Services. This required changes in IT environment: we enhanced data warehouse infrastructure with a data science lab, where we can read predictive model training data from data warehouse database and use the created predictive models in database queries. We then conducted a data science pilot with an objective to predict students' graduation probability and time-to-degree with student registry data. Further ethical and legal considerations are needed before using predictions in daily operations of the university.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05401v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Ontology, Ontologies, and Science	Gary H. Merrill	Aucun	2019-03-09 19:05:25	Philosophers frequently struggle with the relation of metaphysics to the everyday world, with its practical value, and with its relation to empirical science. This paper distinguishes several different models of the relation between philosophical ontology and applied (scientific) ontology that have been advanced in the history of philosophy. Adoption of a strong participation model for the philosophical ontologist in science is urged, and requirements and consequences of the participation model are explored. This approach provides both a principled view and justification of the role of the philosophical ontologist in contemporary empirical science as well as guidelines for integrating philosophers and philosophical contributions into the practice of science.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11245-011-9091-x	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Communicating astronomy with the public: perspectives of an
  international community of practice"	Sara Anjos	Pedro Russo, Anabela Carvalho	2021-06-08 18:14:15	Communities of practice in science communication can make important contributions to public engagement with science but are under-researched. In this article, we look at the perspectives of a community of practice in astronomy communication regarding (relations with) their public(s). Most participants in this study consider that public(s) have several deficits and vulnerabilities. Moreover, practitioners have little to no contact with (and therefore make no use of) academic research on science communication. We argue that collaboration between science communication researchers and practitioners could benefit the science-public relationship and that communities of practice may be critical to that purpose.	http://dx.doi.org/10.22323/2.20030211	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Connecting science fundamentals and career proficiency -- Development of
  multi-disciplinary science curriculum"	Farida Selim	Aucun	2021-09-24 21:25:10	The current conventional approach in teaching STEM seems inadequate; it is failing both the students and the work-force demands in several aspects. Perhaps it is succeeding in equipping students with information and facts but surely falls short in developing them intellectually and in sparking their passion for science. Mixing research with learning by adding components in courses to enforce creativity, reasoning, and to connect the dots between different topics and different subjects can be an effective counter to this tendency. Multi-disciplinary science curriculum connecting the dots between different subjects and the dots between fundamentals and applications and demonstrating clear path to current and future industrial jobs can offer a good approach for STEM education. An example for mutli-disciplinary science course is presented.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12201v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

We have used Scopus database to extract information of social science journals for both countries India and Pakistan. Study of this data is significant as both countries have common social issues and many of common social values. Keywords analysis has been done to see common research areas in both communities like poverty, education, the issue of gender etc. Despite having many of the common social issues, collaboration among social science research communities of both countries is not strong.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01871v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxford-style Debates in Telecommunication and Computer Science Education	Marcin Niemiec	Aucun	2022-06-03 10:42:31	Oxford-style debating is a well-known tool in social sciences. Such formal discussions on particular topics are widely used by historians and sociologists. However, when we try to go beyond standard thinking, it turns out that Oxford-style debating can be a great educational tool in telecommunication and computer science. This article presents this unusual method of education at technical universities and in the IT industry, and describes its features and challenges. Best practices and examples of debating are provided, taking into account emerging topics in telecommunications and computer science, such as cybersecurity. The article also contains feedback from IT engineers who participated in Oxford-style debates. All this aims to encourage this form of education in telecommunication and computer science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03276v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Teaching Color Science to EECS Students Using Interactive Tutorials:
  Tools and Lessons"	Yuhao Zhu	Aucun	2023-01-24 02:39:32	Teaching color science to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) students is critical to preparing them for advanced topics such as graphics, visualization, imaging, Augmented/Virtual Reality. Color historically receive little attention in EECS curriculum; students find it difficult to grasp basic concepts. This is because today's pedagogical approaches are nonintuitive and lack rigor for teaching color science. We develop a set of interactive tutorials that teach color science to EECS students. Each tutorial is backed up by a mathematically rigorous narrative, but is presented in a form that invites students to participate in developing each concept on their own through visualization tools. This paper describes the tutorial series we developed and discusses the design decisions we made.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09788v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Speculative Physics: the Ontology of Theory and Experiment in High
  Energy Particle Physics and Science Fiction"	Clarissa Ai Ling Lee	Aucun	2014-06-21 17:10:25	The dissertation brings together approaches across the fields of physics, critical theory, literary studies, philosophy of physics, sociology of science, and history of science to synthesize a hybrid approach for instigating more rigorous and intense cross-disciplinary interrogations between the sciences and the humanities. There are two levels of conversations going on in the dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction, particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on ethics, culture, and morality.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5636v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

  Science Projects: the case of Zooniverse"	Khairunnisa Ibrahim	Samuel Khodursky, Taha Yasseri	2021-01-07 18:57:51	"Citizen Science is research undertaken by professional scientists and members of the public collaboratively. Despite numerous benefits of citizen science for both the advancement of science and the community of the citizen scientists, there is still no comprehensive knowledge of patterns of contributions, and the demography of contributors to citizen science projects. In this paper we provide a first overview of spatiotemporal and gender distribution of citizen science workforce by analyzing 54 million classifications contributed by more than 340 thousand citizen science volunteers from 198 countries to one of the largest citizen science platforms, Zooniverse. First we report on the uneven geographical distribution of the citizen scientist and model the variations among countries based on the socio-economic conditions as well as the level of research investment in each country. Analyzing the temporal features of contributions, we report on high ""burstiness"" of participation instances as well as the leisurely nature of participation suggested by the time of the day that the citizen scientists were the most active. Finally, we discuss the gender imbalance among citizen scientists (about 30% female) and compare it with other collaborative projects as well as the gender distribution in more formal scientific activities. Citizen science projects need further attention from outside of the academic community, and our findings can help attract the attention of public and private stakeholders, as well as to inform the design of the platforms and science policy making processes."	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2021.650720	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Computational Skills by Stealth in Secondary School Data Science	Wesley Burr	Fanny Chevalier, Christopher Collins, Alison L Gibbs, Raymond Ng, Chris Wild	2020-10-08 09:11:51	The unprecedented growth in the availability of data of all types and qualities and the emergence of the field of data science has provided an impetus to finally realizing the implementation of the full breadth of the Nolan and Temple Lang proposed integration of computing concepts into statistics curricula at all levels in statistics and new data science programs and courses. Moreover, data science, implemented carefully, opens accessible pathways to stem for students for whom neither mathematics nor computer science are natural affinities, and who would traditionally be excluded. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' first exposure to data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. The intent of this approach is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. This discussion is presented in the context of the International Data Science in Schools Project which recently published computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks for a two-year secondary school data science program, designed to make data science accessible to all.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07017v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Political Partisanship and Anti-Science Attitudes in Online Discussions
  about Covid-19"	Ashwin Rao	Fred Morstatter, Minda Hu, Emily Chen, Keith Burghardt, Emilio Ferrara, Kristina Lerman	2020-11-17 08:22:20	The novel coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage communities across the US. Opinion surveys identified importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. Here, we use social media data to study complexity of polarization. We analyze a large dataset of tweets related to the pandemic collected between January and May of 2020, and develop methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative) and science (anti-science vs pro-science) dimensions. While polarization along the science and political dimensions are correlated, politically moderate users are more likely to be aligned with the pro-science views, and politically hardline users with anti-science views. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that polarization grows over time; instead, we see increasing activity by moderate pro-science users. We also show that anti-science conservatives tend to tweet from the Southern US, while anti-science moderates from the Western states. Our findings shed light on the multi-dimensional nature of polarization, and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08498v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

  bibliometric analysis of research publications from 1960-2021"	Stefan Hajkowicz	Conrad Sanderson, Sarvnaz Karimi, Alexandra Bratanova, Claire Naughtin	2023-06-15 14:08:07	"Analysing historical patterns of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption can inform decisions about AI capability uplift, but research to date has provided a limited view of AI adoption across various fields of research. In this study we examine worldwide adoption of AI technology within 333 fields of research during 1960-2021. We do this by using bibliometric analysis with 137 million peer-reviewed publications captured in The Lens database. We define AI using a list of 214 phrases developed by expert working groups at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We found that 3.1 million of the 137 million peer-reviewed research publications during the entire period were AI-related, with a surge in AI adoption across practically all research fields (physical science, natural science, life science, social science and the arts and humanities) in recent years. The diffusion of AI beyond computer science was early, rapid and widespread. In 1960 14% of 333 research fields were related to AI (many in computer science), but this increased to cover over half of all research fields by 1972, over 80% by 1986 and over 98% in current times. We note AI has experienced boom-bust cycles historically: the AI ""springs"" and ""winters"". We conclude that the context of the current surge appears different, and that interdisciplinary AI application is likely to be sustained."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102260	cs	arxiv					0.0

""IMP Science Gateway Portal"" (http://scigate.imp.kiev.ua) for complex workflow management and integration of distributed computing resources (like clusters, service grids, desktop grids, clouds) is presented. It is created on the basis of WS-PGRADE and gUSE technologies, where WS-PGRADE is designed for science workflow operation and gUSE - for smooth integration of available resources for parallel and distributed computing in various heterogeneous distributed computing infrastructures (DCI). The typical scientific workflows with possible scenarios of its preparation and usage are presented. Several typical use cases for these science applications (scientific workflows) are considered for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex behavior of various nanostructures (nanoindentation of graphene layers, defect system relaxation in metal nanocrystals, thermal stability of boron nitride nanotubes, etc.). The user experience is analyzed in the context of its practical applications for MD simulations in materials science, physics and nanotechnologies with available heterogeneous DCIs. In conclusion, the ""science gateway"" approach - workflow manager (like WS-PGRADE) + DCI resources manager (like gUSE)- gives opportunity to use the SG portal (like ""IMP Science Gateway Portal"") in a very promising way, namely, as a hub of various virtual experimental labs (different software components + various requirements to resources) in the context of its practical MD applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnologies."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5611v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Typologies of the Popular Science Web Video	Jesús Muñoz Morcillo	Klemens Czurda, Caroline Y. Robertson-von Trotha	2015-06-19 20:20:52	The creation of popular science web videos on the Internet has increased in recent years. The diversity of formats, genres, and producers makes it difficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not every producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an institutional sense, and professionalism and success on video platforms no longer depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs. Entertainment, content quality, and authenticity have become the keys to community building and success. The democratization of science video production allows a new variety of genres, styles, and forms. This article provides a first overview of the typologies and characteristics of popular science web videos. To avoid a misleading identification of science web videos with institutionally produced videos, we steer clear of the term science communication video, since many of the actual producers are not even familiar with the academic discussion on science communication, and since the subject matter does not depend on political or educational strategies. A content analysis of 200 videos from 100 online video channels was conducted. Several factors such as narrative strategies, video editing techniques, and design tendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of montage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to an increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of institutional or personal commitments: in general, it can be said that supposed amateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. This study represents an important step in understanding the essence of current popular science web videos and provides an evidence-based definition as a helpful cornerstone for further studies on science communication within this kind of new media.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06149v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The role of project science in the Chandra X-ray Observatory	Stephen L. O'Dell	Martin C. Weisskopf	2006-06-14 19:36:47	"The Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of NASA's Great Observatories, has an outstanding record of scientific and technical success. This success results from the efforts of a team comprising NASA, its contractors, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the instrument groups, and other elements of the scientific community -- including the thousands of scientists who utilize this powerful facility for astrophysical research. We discuss the role of NASA Project Science in the formulation, development, calibration, and operation of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In addition to serving as an interface between the scientific community and the Project, Project Science performed what we term ""science systems engineering"". This activity encompasses translation of science requirements into technical requirements and assessment of the scientific impact of programmatic and technical trades. We briefly describe several examples of science systems engineering conducted by Chandra Project Science."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.671789	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Astronomical Science with Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics: A Brief
  Review, a Current Snapshot, and a Bright Future"	Michael C. Liu	Aucun	2006-09-07 20:00:07	We briefly discuss the past, present, and future state of astronomical science with laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO). We present a tabulation of refereed science papers from LGS AO, amounting to a total of 23 publications as of May 2006. The first decade of LGS AO science (1995-2004) was marked by modest science productivity (~1 paper/year), as LGS systems were being implemented and commissioned. The last two years have seen explosive science growth (~1 paper/month), largely due to the new LGS system on the Keck II 10-meter telescope, and point to an exciting new era for high angular resolution science. To illustrate the achievable on-sky performance, we present an extensive collection of Keck LGS performance measurements from the first year of our brown dwarf near-IR imaging survey. We summarize the current strengths and weaknesses of LGS compared to Hubble Space Telescope, offer a list of desired improvements, and look forward to a bright future for LGS given its wide-scale implementation on large ground-based telescopes.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.672759	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Global Map of Science Based on the ISI Subject Categories	Loet Leydesdorff	Ismael Rafols	2009-11-05 15:28:51	"The ISI subject categories classify journals included in the Science Citation Index (SCI). The aggregated journal-journal citation matrix contained in the Journal Citation Reports can be aggregated on the basis of these categories. This leads to an asymmetrical transaction matrix (citing versus cited) which is much more densely populated than the underlying matrix at the journal level. Exploratory factor analysis leads us to opt for a fourteen-factor solution. This solution can easily be interpreted as the disciplinary structure of science. The nested maps of science (corresponding to 14 factors, 172 categories, and 6,164 journals) are brought online at http://www.leydesdorff.net/map06/index.htm. An analysis of interdisciplinary relations is pursued at three levels of aggregation using the newly added ISI subject category of ""Nanoscience & nanotechnology"". The journal level provides the finer grained perspective. Errors in the attribution of journals to the ISI subject categories are averaged out so that the factor analysis can reveal the main structures. The mapping of science can, therefore, be comprehensive at the level of ISI subject categories."	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1057v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A Meta-evaluation of Scientific Research Proposals: Different Ways of
  Comparing Rejected to Awarded Applications"	Lutz Bornmann	Loet Leydesdorff, Peter van den Besselaar	2009-11-18 14:41:41	Combining different data sets with information on grant and fellowship applications submitted to two renowned funding agencies, we are able to compare their funding decisions (award and rejection) with scientometric performance indicators across two fields of science (life sciences and social sciences). The data sets involve 671 applications in social sciences and 668 applications in life sciences. In both fields, awarded applicants perform on average better than all rejected applicants. If only the most preeminent rejected applicants are considered in both fields, they score better than the awardees on citation impact. With regard to productivity we find differences between the fields: While the awardees in life sciences outperform on average the most preeminent rejected applicants, the situation is reversed in social sciences.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3558v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Import and Export of Cognitive Science	Rob Goldstone	Loet Leydesdorff	2009-11-18 20:00:02	From its inception, a large part of the motivation for Cognitive Science has been the need for an interdisciplinary journal for the study of minds and intelligent systems. One threat to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive Science, both the field and journal, is that it may become, or already be, too dominated by psychologists. In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence (13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) gathers data not only on how individual articles cite one another, but also on macroscopic citation patterns among journals. Journals or sets of journals can be considered as proxies for fields. As fields become established, they often create journals. By studying the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related to cognitive science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3641v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Science Models as Value-Added Services for Scholarly Information Systems	Peter Mutschke	Philipp Mayr, Philipp Schaer, York Sure	2011-05-12 12:07:42	The paper introduces scholarly Information Retrieval (IR) as a further dimension that should be considered in the science modeling debate. The IR use case is seen as a validation model of the adequacy of science models in representing and predicting structure and dynamics in science. Particular conceptualizations of scholarly activity and structures in science are used as value-added search services to improve retrieval quality: a co-word model depicting the cognitive structure of a field (used for query expansion), the Bradford law of information concentration, and a model of co-authorship networks (both used for re-ranking search results). An evaluation of the retrieval quality when science model driven services are used turned out that the models proposed actually provide beneficial effects to retrieval quality. From an IR perspective, the models studied are therefore verified as expressive conceptualizations of central phenomena in science. Thus, it could be shown that the IR perspective can significantly contribute to a better understanding of scholarly structures and activities.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-011-0430-x	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Criteria of Science, Cosmology, and Lessons of History	Helge Kragh	Aucun	2012-08-26 10:52:25	Perhaps more than any other of the physical sciences, cosmology exemplifies the inevitable contact between science and philosophy, including the problem of the demarcation criteria that distinguish science from non-science. Although modern physical cosmology is undoubtedly scientific, it is not obvious why it has this status, and nor is it obvious that all branches of theoretical cosmology satisfy ordinarily assumed criteria for science. While testability is generally admitted as an indispensable criterion for a theory being scientific, there is no agreement among cosmologists what testability means, more precisely. For example, should testability be taken to imply falsifiability in the sense of Popper? I discuss this and related questions by referring to two episodes of controversy in the history of modern cosmology, the debate over the steady state theory in the 1950s and the recent debate concerned with the anthropic multiverse. In addition, I draw attention to the use of historical analogies in cosmological and other scientific arguments, suggesting that such use is often misuse or otherwise based on distortions of the history of science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5215v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Networks in Cognitive Science	Andrea Baronchelli	Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras, Nick Chater, Morten H. Christiansen	2013-04-24 20:16:21	Networks of interconnected nodes have long played a key role in Cognitive Science, from artificial neural net- works to spreading activation models of semantic mem- ory. Recently, however, a new Network Science has been developed, providing insights into the emergence of global, system-scale properties in contexts as diverse as the Internet, metabolic reactions, and collaborations among scientists. Today, the inclusion of network theory into Cognitive Sciences, and the expansion of complex- systems science, promises to significantly change the way in which the organization and dynamics of cognitive and behavioral processes are understood. In this paper, we review recent contributions of network theory at different levels and domains within the Cognitive Sciences.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.04.010	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Becoming the Change: A Critical Evaluation of the Changing Face of Life
  Science, as Reflected in the NGSS"	Larry L Bowman, Jr.	Aimee L Govett	2014-01-21 20:09:33	"Tennessee is one of the 26 lead state partners that volunteered to provide leadership and guidance to states for the purpose of adoption of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS. As stated in the Tennessee Vision for STEM Education (2009), ""Tennessee recognizes the importance of science and aims to commit to this understanding by becoming involved in the development, and eventual adoption and implementation of NGSS."" The present study correlates the Tennessee State Science Standards to the NGSS for High School Biology/ Life Sciences and examines the need for a dynamic set of standards that teach the technical skills and critical thinking needed in these scientific fields. The NGSS addresses a move from dated scientific quandaries and proposes standards supported by cutting edge scientific research and literature. Partnerships between scientists and educators allow for the information exchange necessary to implement the changes in scientific research in K-12 instruction. Professional development opportunities that include direct partnerships with scientists foster the continued understanding and skills required to teach science."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5681v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Operationalization of ""Fields"" as WoS Subject Categories (WCs) in
  Evaluative Bibliometrics: The cases of ""Library and Information Science"" and
  ""Science & Technology Studies"""	Loet Leydesdorff	Lutz Bornmann	2014-07-29 19:54:33	"Normalization of citation scores using reference sets based on Web-of-Science Subject Categories (WCs) has become an established (""best"") practice in evaluative bibliometrics. For example, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings are, among other things, based on this operationalization. However, WCs were developed decades ago for the purpose of information retrieval and evolved incrementally with the database; the classification is machine-based and partially manually corrected. Using the WC ""information science & library science"" and the WCs attributed to journals in the field of ""science and technology studies,"" we show that WCs do not provide sufficient analytical clarity to carry bibliometric normalization in evaluation practices because of ""indexer effects."" Can the compliance with ""best practices"" be replaced with an ambition to develop ""best possible practices""? New research questions can then be envisaged."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7849v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Data Science and Ebola	Aske Plaat	Aucun	2015-04-11 14:14:08	Data Science---Today, everybody and everything produces data. People produce large amounts of data in social networks and in commercial transactions. Medical, corporate, and government databases continue to grow. Sensors continue to get cheaper and are increasingly connected, creating an Internet of Things, and generating even more data. In every discipline, large, diverse, and rich data sets are emerging, from astrophysics, to the life sciences, to the behavioral sciences, to finance and commerce, to the humanities and to the arts. In every discipline people want to organize, analyze, optimize and understand their data to answer questions and to deepen insights. The science that is transforming this ocean of data into a sea of knowledge is called data science. This lecture will discuss how data science has changed the way in which one of the most visible challenges to public health is handled, the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02878v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Epistemic Impact on Group Problem Solving for Different Science Majors	Andrew J. Mason	Charles A. Bertram	2016-02-28 04:27:44	Implementation of cognitive apprenticeship in an introductory physics lab group problem solving exercise may be mitigated by epistemic views toward physics of non-physics science majors. Quantitative pre-post data of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and Colorado Learning Attitudes About Science Survey (CLASS) of 39 students of a first-semester algebra-based introductory physics course, while describing typical results for a traditional-format course overall (g = +0.14), suggest differences in epistemic views between health science majors and life science majors which may correlate with differences in pre-post conceptual understanding. Audiovisual data of student lab groups working on a context-rich problem and students' written reflections described each group's typical dynamics and invoked epistemic games. We examined the effects of framework-based orientation (favored by biology majors) and performance-based orientation (favored by computer science, chemistry, and health science majors) on pre-post attitude survey performance. We also investigated possible correlations of these orientations with individual quantitative survey results, and with qualitative audiovisual data of lab groups' choice of epistemic games.	http://dx.doi.org/10.17265/2161-623X/2014.12A.005	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Automaticity in Computation and Student Success in Introductory Physical
  Science Courses"	JudithAnn R. Hartman	Eric A. Nelson	2016-08-17 16:07:57	Between 1984 and 2011, the percentage of US bachelor degrees awarded in physics declined by 25%, in chemistry declined by 33%, and overall in physical sciences and engineering fell 40%. Data suggest that these declines are correlated to a deemphasis in most states of practicing computation skills in mathematics. Analysis of state standards put into place between 1990 and 2010 find that most states directed teachers to deemphasize both memorization and student practice in computational problem solving. Available state test score data show a significant decline in student computation skills. In recent international testing, scores for US 16 to 24 year olds in numeracy finished last among 22 tested nations in the OECD. Recent studies in cognitive science have found that to solve well-structured problems in the sciences, students must first memorize fundamental facts and procedures in mathematics and science until they can be recalled with automaticity, then practice applying those skills in a variety of distinctive contexts. Actions are suggested to improve US STEM graduation rates by aligning US math and science curricula with the recommendations of cognitive science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05006v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Computer simulations in science and engineering - Concepts - Practices -
  Perspectives"	Juan M. Durán	Aucun	2019-03-09 15:26:05	The ubiquitous presence of computer simulations in all kinds of research areas evidence their role as the new driving force for the advancement of science and engineering research. Nothing seems to escape the image of success that computer simulations project onto the research community and the general public. One simple way to illustrate this consists of asking ourselves how would contemporary science and engineering look like without the use of computer simulations. The answer would certainly diverge from the current image we have of scientific and engineering research.   As much as computer simulations are successful, they are also methods that fail in their purpose of inquiring about the world; and as much as researchers make use of them, computer simulations raise important questions that are at the heart of contemporary science and engineering practice. In this respect, computer simulations make a fantastic subject of research for the natural sciences, the social sciences, engineering and, as in our case, also for philosophy. Studies on computer simulations touch upon many different facets of scientific and engineering research and evoke philosophically inclined questions of interpretation with close ties to problems in experimental settings and engineering applications (...)	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01053v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Science and its significant other: Representing the humanities in
  bibliometric scholarship"	Thomas Franssen	Paul Wouters	2017-10-11 11:13:58	Bibliometrics offers a particular representation of science. Through bibliometric methods a bibliometrician will always highlight particular elements of publications, and through these elements operationalize particular representations of science, while obscuring other possible representations from view. Understanding bibliometrics as representation implies that a bibliometric analysis is always performative: a bibliometric analysis brings a particular representation of science into being that potentially influences the science system itself. In this review we analyze the ways the humanities have been represented throughout the history of bibliometrics, often in comparison to other scientific domains or to a general notion of the sciences. Our review discusses bibliometric scholarship between 1965 and 2016 that studies the humanities empirically. We distinguish between two periods of bibliometric scholarship. The first period, between 1965 and 1989, is characterized by a sociological theoretical framework, the development and use of the Price index, and small samples of journal publications as data sources. The second period, from the mid-1980s up until the present day, is characterized by a new hinterland, that of science policy and research evaluation, in which bibliometric methods become embedded.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04004v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Chemistry Between High School Students and Computer Science	Timothy T. Lenczycki	Kelly Suto, Christina Williams, Michelle Mills Strout	2014-06-09 15:44:41	Computer science enrollments have started to rise again, but the percentage of women undergraduates in computer science is still low. Some studies indicate this might be due to a lack of awareness of computer science at the high school level. We present our experiences running a 5-year, high school outreach program that introduces information about computer science within the context of required chemistry courses. We developed interactive worksheets using Molecular Workbench that help the students learn chemistry and computer science concepts related to relevant events such as the gulf oil spill. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach indicates that the students do become more aware of computer science as a discipline, but system support issues in the classroom can make the approach difficult for teachers and discouraging for the students.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2222v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Knowledge discovery via multidimensional science maps: the case of the
  Species Problem"	Sandor Soos	Aucun	2014-09-24 14:05:26	Science mapping (SM), the study of the organization and development of science and technology, is a rapidly developing field within information science. The volume of available data allows this methodology to empirically address such issues as the historical development of topics, discourses, fields or the entire science system. Based on the pool of related methods, we are proposing an integration of various maps to obtain a novel kind of science map we call multidimensional. The basic idea behind is to combine the most informative relations available from various maps based on different bibliometric indicators, in order to produce a rich structrue for the study of knowledge dynamics, with special emphasis on causal-historical connections. As a proof of concept, we deploy the proposed framework in an extensive case study on a historical topic from the life sciences, namely, the debate on the species concept in biosystematics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6964v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
What is online citizen science anyway? An educational perspective	Cathal Doyle	Yevgeniya Li, Markus Luczak-Roesch, Dayle Anderson, Brigitte Glasson, Matthew Boucher, Carol Brieseman, Dianne Christenson, Melissa Coton	2018-04-20 01:49:09	In this paper we seek to contribute to the debate about the nature of citizen involvement in real scientific projects by the means of online tools that facilitate crowdsourcing and collaboration. We focus on an understudied area, the impact of online citizen science participation on the science education of school age children. We present a binary tree of online citizen science process flows and the results of an anonymous survey among primary school teachers in New Zealand that are known advocates of science education. Our findings reveal why teachers are interested in using online citizen science in classroom activities and what they are looking for when making their choice for a particular project to use. From these characteristics we derive recommendations for the optimal embedding of online citizen science in education related to the process, the context, and the dissemination of results.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00441v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
NOMAD: The FAIR Concept for Big-Data-Driven Materials Science	Claudia Draxl	Matthias Scheffler	2018-05-14 07:43:10	Data is a crucial raw material of this century, and the amount of data that has been created in materials science in recent years and is being created every new day is immense. Without a proper infrastructure that allows for collecting and sharing data (including the original data), the envisioned success of materials science and, in particular, Big-Data driven materials science will be hampered. For the field of computational materials science, the NOMAD (Novel Materials Discovery) Center of Excellence (CoE) has changed the scientific culture towards a comprehensive and FAIR data sharing, opening new avenues for mining Big-Data of materials science. Novel data-analytics concepts and tools turn data into knowledge and help the prediction of new materials or the identification of new properties of already known materials.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05039v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Movement science needs different pose tracking algorithms	Nidhi Seethapathi	Shaofei Wang, Rachit Saluja, Gunnar Blohm, Konrad P. Kording	2019-07-24 03:54:22	Over the last decade, computer science has made progress towards extracting body pose from single camera photographs or videos. This promises to enable movement science to detect disease, quantify movement performance, and take the science out of the lab into the real world. However, current pose tracking algorithms fall short of the needs of movement science; the types of movement data that matter are poorly estimated. For instance, the metrics currently used for evaluating pose tracking algorithms use noisy hand-labeled ground truth data and do not prioritize precision of relevant variables like three-dimensional position, velocity, acceleration, and forces which are crucial for movement science. Here, we introduce the scientific disciplines that use movement data, the types of data they need, and discuss the changes needed to make pose tracking truly transformative for movement science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10226v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Coercion, Consent, and Participation in Citizen Science	Alison Reiheld	Pamela L. Gay	2019-07-29 03:48:21	Throughout history, everyday people have contributed to science through a myriad of volunteer activities. This early participation required training and often involved mentorship from scientists or senior citizen scientists (or, as they were often called, gentleman scientists). During this learning process, participants learned how they and their data would be used both to advance science, and in some cases, advance the careers of professional collaborators. Modern, online citizen science, allows participation with just a few clicks, and people may participate without understanding what they are contributing to. Too often, they happily see what they are doing as the privilege of painting Tom Sawyer's fence without realizing they are actually being used as merely a means to a scientific end. This paper discusses the ethical dilemmas that plague modern citizen science, including: the issues of informed consent, such as not requiring logins; the issues of coercion inherent in mandatory classroom assignments requiring data submission; and the issues of using people merely as a means to an end that are inherent in technonationalism, and projects that do not provide utility to the users beyond the knowledge they helped. This work is tested within the context of astronomy citizen science.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13061v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Agnostic Structure of Data Science Methods	Domenico Napoletani	Marco Panza, Daniele Struppa	2021-01-27 02:32:35	In this paper we argue that data science is a coherent and novel approach to empirical problems that, in its most general form, does not build understanding about phenomena. Within the new type of mathematization at work in data science, mathematical methods are not selected because of any relevance for a problem at hand; mathematical methods are applied to a specific problem only by 'forcing', i.e. on the basis of their ability to reorganize the data for further analysis and the intrinsic richness of their mathematical structure. In particular, we argue that deep learning neural networks are best understood within the context of forcing optimization methods. We finally explore the broader question of the appropriateness of data science methods in solving problems. We argue that this question should not be interpreted as a search for a correspondence between phenomena and specific solutions found by data science methods; rather, it is the internal structure of data science methods that is open to precise forms of understanding.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12150v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

  Science"	Rima Hazra	Mayank Singh, Pawan Goyal, Bibhas Adhikari, Animesh Mukherjee	2019-08-10 17:58:19	The distinction between sciences is becoming increasingly more artificial -- an approach from one area can be easily applied to the other. More exciting research nowadays is happening perhaps at the interfaces of disciplines like Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. How do these interfaces emerge and interact? For instance, is there a specific pattern in which these fields cite each other? In this article, we investigate a collection of more than 1.2 million papers from three different scientific disciplines -- Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. We show how over a timescale the citation patterns from the core science fields (Physics, Mathematics) to the applied and fast-growing field of Computer Science have drastically increased. Further, we observe how certain subfields in these disciplines are shrinking while others are becoming tremendously popular. For instance, an intriguing observation is that citations from Mathematics to the subfield of machine learning in Computer Science in recent times are exponentially increasing.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03793v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Furthermore, we show that the embeddings capture meaningful ""axes"" that encompass knowledge domains, such as an axis from ""soft"" to ""hard"" sciences or from ""social"" to ""biological"" sciences, which allow us to quantitatively ground periodicals on a given dimension.

Data Science: Challenges and Directions	Longbing Cao	Aucun	2020-06-28 01:49:00	While data science has emerged as a contentious new scientific field, enormous debates and discussions have been made on it why we need data science and what makes it as a science. In reviewing hundreds of pieces of literature which include data science in their titles, we find that the majority of the discussions essentially concern statistics, data mining, machine learning, big data, or broadly data analytics, and only a limited number of new data-driven challenges and directions have been explored. In this paper, we explore the intrinsic challenges and directions inspired by comprehensively exploring the complexities and intelligence embedded in data science problems. We focus on the research and innovation challenges inspired by the nature of data science problems as complex systems, and the methodologies for handling such systems.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3015456	cs	arxiv					0.0

Now, with the number of prospective DA/DS, you don't just have to stand out, you need to be head and shoulders above the competition. It has already been 4 months since I resigned from my teaching job and I have yet to receive any job. And this is after applying to close to 200 jobs already.     I think posts like this is important too to give career shifters a more balanced view on what the landscape currently looks like. If you are planning on shifting, do know that it isn't as easy as it used to be. The competition out here is fierce. Whatever DA/DS people have promised you about the Data job market, take it with a grain of salt. Always consider survivor bias. I may simply be one of the many shifters that didn't make the cut."	https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/16o7chj/failed_data_analystdata_science_shifter/		reddit	16o7chj	phcareers	170.0	170.0	50.0	Career Path

What to do with a political science degree?	bc-1929	Aucun	2023-06-03 23:21:06	hi ! I am 19 years old and about to go into my third year of college at CU Boulder. I am working towards a political science degree with a minor in public engagement. I've hit that crisis where I don't know what I actually want to do with my life. Originally, I had wanted to study criminal justice but my university did not offer that so I picked the next best option. When I started college I was very passionate about being a politician, but that motivation has since faded. Thinking that I may not be cut out for what a career in politics has turned into. I could be interested in something media related in the field but am not sure what I should be doing to prepare for that. I'm feeling very lost on where to take my degree and what I should be focusing on after I get my bachelors. I feel like I am wasting so much time working towards something I am not passionate about anymore but I'm also too far in to change my mind.   I do think law school could be a good option for me but do not want to commit to the time and money if I am not absolutely set on it.   I'd like to hear from other people with political science degrees, what they are doing career-wise, and how they get onto that track. Also, if anyone has taken a political science degree into the criminal justice field I'd love to know the details. Basically, I'd just like any guidance in general for what to do with my life haha.	https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/13ztdmd/what_to_do_with_a_political_science_degree/		reddit	13ztdmd	careerguidance	100.0	100.0	138.0	Edit with your location

"Is ""data science"" a bubble about to burst?"	aksha2161989	Aucun	2022-12-31 02:56:16	I spoke to an experienced guy in the IT sector who has worked in many FinTech firms and consulting companies. He said when the data science hype started several years back, companies started getting funds from venture capitalists to set up data science wings . Companies went on a hiring spree with this money to hire data science professionals.   However, as the years passed, these data science departments failed to generate revenue as expected.  Also, some aspects of data science will very likely be automated. So companies will probably hire less data science professionals and may even fire the resources hired earlier.  Is this correct? What do you think?	https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/zzji46/is_data_science_a_bubble_about_to_burst/		reddit	zzji46	developersIndia	170.0	170.0	49.0	General

Is it even worth majoring in Computer Science?

And before you get mad this is just a random assumption   Like already I saw a LPT about harvards CS50 class and it’s likely to be seen by 100k+ people. There’s so much talented people out there and I respect that, but to some or me, is it even worth it pursing this as a career.  Like why do this if you’re going to be competing against millions of people which a fraction are crazy talented and hardworking.	https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/v3sibl/is_it_even_worth_majoring_in_computer_science/		reddit	v3sibl	learnprogramming	23.0	23.0	32.0	Topic

Science Discussion Series: Climate Change is in the news so let’s talk about it! We’re experts in climate science and science communication, let’s discuss!	ScienceModerator	Aucun	2019-09-20 12:47:56	"[Hi reddit!](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png) This month the UN is holding its [Climate Action Summit](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/un-climate-summit-2019.shtml), it is [New York City's Climate Week](https://www.climateweeknyc.org/) next week, today is the [Global Climate Strike](https://globalclimatestrike.net/), earlier this month was the [Asia Pacific Climate Week](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/f0e05f_744d71823692423c89830a8a843eb617.pdf), and there are many more local events happening. Since climate change is in the news a lot let’s talk about it!  We're a panel of experts who study and communicate about climate change's causes, impacts, and solutions, and we're here to answer your questions about it! Is there something about the science of climate change you never felt you fully understood? Questions about a claim you saw online or on the news? Want to better understand why you should care and how it will impact you? Or do you just need tips for talking to your family about climate change at Thanksgiving this year? We can help!  **Here are some general resources for you to explore and learn about the climate:**  * AAAS just released a report with case studies and videos of how communities and companies (and individuals) in the US are working with scientists to respond to climate change called ""[How We Respond](https://howwerespond.aaas.org)."" * NASA: [Vital Signs of the Planet](https://climate.nasa.gov/) * National Academies of Sciences: [Climate Change Evidence and Causes](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18730/climate-change-evidence-and-causes) * National Geographic: [Seven things to know about Climate Change](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/climate-change/)  **Today's guests are:**  **Emily Cloyd** (u/BotanyAndDragons): I'm the director for the American Association for the Advancement of Science [Center for Public Engagement with Science and Technology](https://www.aaas.org/programs/center-public-engagement-science-and-technology), where I oversee programs including [How We Respond: Community Responses to Climate Change](https://howwerespond.aaas.org/) (just released!), the [Leshner Leadership Institute](https://leshnerfellows.aaas.org/), and the [AAAS IF/THEN Ambassadors](https://www.aaas.org/news/125-women-stem-selected-aaas-ifthen-ambassadors), and study best practices for [science communication](http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/2027.42/150489) and [policy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0318-6) [engagement](https://www.american.edu/spa/scicomm/). Prior to joining AAAS, I led [engagement and outreach](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1568-y) for the [Third National Climate Assessment](https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), served as a [Knauss Marine Policy Fellow](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/Knauss-Fellowship-Program) at the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/data_reports/establishing-national-ocean-service-priorities-for-estuarine-coastal-and-ocean-modeling-capabilities-gaps-and-preliminary-prioritization-factors/), and studied [the use of ecological models in Great Lakes management](https://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GreatLakesRpt.pdf). I hold a Master's in Conservation Biology (SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry) and a Bachelor's in Plant Biology (University of Michigan), am always up for a paddle (especially if it is in a dragon boat), and last year hiked the Tour du Mont Blanc.  **Jeff Dukes** (u/Jeff_Dukes): My research generally examines how plants and ecosystems respond to a changing environment, focusing on topics from invasive species to climate change. Much of my experimental work seeks to inform and improve climate models. The center I direct has been leading the Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment (INCCIA); that's available at [IndianaClimate.org](http://indianaclimate.org/). You can find more information about me at [https://web.ics.purdue.edu/\~jsdukes/lab/index.html](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jsdukes/lab/index.html), and more information about the Purdue Climate Change Research Center at [http://purdue.edu/climate](http://purdue.edu/climate).  **Hussein R. Sayani** (u/Hussein_Sayani): I'm a climate scientist at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I develop records of past ocean temperature, salinity, and wind variability in the tropical Pacific by measuring changes in the chemistry of fossil corals. These past climate records allow us to understand past climate changes in the tropical Pacific, a region that profoundly influences temperature and rainfall patterns around the planet, so that we can improve future predictions of global and regional climate change.   **Jessica Moerman** (u/Jessica_Moerman): Hi reddit! My name is Jessica Moerman and I study how climate changed in the past - before we had weather stations. How you might ask? I study the chemical fingerprints of geologic archives like cave stalagmites, lake sediments, and ancient soil deposits to discover how temperature and rainfall varied over the last several ice age cycles. I have a Ph.D. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences from the Georgia Institute of Technology and have conducted research at Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. I am now a AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow working on climate and environmental issues.   Our guests will be joining us throughout the day (primarily in the afternoon Eastern Time) to answer your questions and discuss!"	https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/d6uez5/science_discussion_series_climate_change_is_in/		reddit	d6uez5	science	28505.0	28505.0	2579.0	Climate Discussion
