"May oxygen depletion explain the FLASH effect? A chemical track
  structure analysis"	Daria Boscolo	Emanuele Scifoni, Marco Durante, Michael Krämer, Martina C. Fuss	2021-01-22 09:12:55	"Background and purpose: Recent observations in animal models show that ultra-high dose rate (""FLASH"") radiation treatment significantly reduces normal tissue toxicity maintaining an equivalent tumor control. The dependence of this ""FLASH"" effect on target oxygenation has led to the assumption that oxygen ""depletion"" could be its major driving force. Materials and Methods: In a bottom-up approach starting from the chemical track evolution of 1 MeV electrons in oxygenated water simulated with the TRAX-CHEM Monte Carlo code, we determine the oxygen consumption and radiolytic reactive oxygen species production following a short radiation pulse. Based on these values, the effective dose weighted by oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) or the in vitro cell survival under dynamic oxygen pressure is calculated and compared to that of conventional exposures, at constant OER. Results: We find an excellent agreement of our Monte Carlo predictions with the experimental value for radiolytic oxygen removal from oxygenated water. However, the application of the present model to published radiobiological experiment conditions shows that oxygen depletion can only have a negligible impact on radiosensitivity through oxygen enhancement, especially at typical experimental oxygenations where a FLASH effect has been observed. Conclusion: We show that the magnitude and dependence of the ""oxygen depletion"" hypothesis are not consistent with the observed biological effects of FLASH irradiation. While oxygenation plays an undoubted role in mediating the FLASH effect, we conclude that state-of-the-art radiation chemistry models do not support oxygen depletion and radiation-induced transient hypoxia as the main mechanism."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2021.06.031	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On the maximum value of the cosmic abundance of oxygen and the oxygen
  yield"	L. S. Pilyugin	T. X. Thuan, J. M. Vilchez	2007-01-11 14:14:18	We search for the maximum oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies. Because this maximum value is expected to occur in the centers of the most luminous galaxies, we have constructed the luminosity - central metallicity diagram for spiral galaxies, based on a large compilation of existing data on oxygen abundances of HII regions in spiral galaxies. We found that this diagram shows a plateau at high luminosities (-22.3 < M_B < -20.3), with a constant maximum value of the gas-phase oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.87. This provides strong evidence that the oxygen abundance in the centers of the most luminous metal-rich galaxies reaches the maximum attainable value of oxygen abundance. Since some fraction of the oxygen (about 0.08 dex) is expected to be locked into dust grains, the maximum value of the true gas+dust oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies is 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.95. This value is a factor of ~ 2 higher than the recently estimated solar value. Based on the derived maximum oxygen abundance in galaxies, we found the oxygen yield to be about 0.0035, depending on the fraction of oxygen incorporated into dust grains.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11444.x	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen and Cation Ordered Perovskite, Ba2Y2Mn4O11	M. Karppinen	H. Okamoto, H. Fjellvag, T. Motohashi, H. Yamauchi	2004-02-09 03:57:45	A three-step route has been developed for the synthesis of a new oxygen-ordered double perovskite, BaYMn2O5.5 or Ba2Y2Mn4O11. (i) The A-site cation ordered perovskite, BaYMn2O5+d, is first synthesized at d ~ 0 by an oxygen-getter-controlled low-O2-pressure encapsulation technique utilizing FeO as the getter for excess oxygen. (ii) The as-synthesized, oxygen-deficient BaYMn2O5.0 phase is then readily oxygenated to the d ~ 1 level by means of 1-atm-O2 annealing at low temperatures. (iii) By annealing this fully-oxygenated BaYMn2O6.0 in flowing N2 gas at moderate temperatures the new intermediate-oxygen-content oxide, BaYMn2O5.5 or Ba2Y2Mn4O11, is finally obtained. From thermogravimetric observation it is seen that the final oxygen depletion from d ~ 1.0 to 0.5 occurs in a single sharp step about 600 C, implying that the oxygen stoichiometry of BaYMn2O5+d is not continuously tunable within 0.5 < d < 1.0. For BaYMn2O5.5 synchrotron x-ray diffraction analysis reveals an orthorhombic crystal lattice and a long-range ordering of the excess oxygen atoms in the YO0.5 layer. The magnetic behavior of BaYMn2O5.5 (with a ferromagnetic transition at ~ 133 K) is found different from those previously reported for the known phases, BaYMn2O5.0 and BaYMn2O6.0.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssc.2004.02.003	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Computational Discovery of Fast Interstitial Oxygen Conductors	Jun Meng	Md Sariful Sheikh, Ryan Jacobs, Jian Liu, William O. Nachlas, Xiangguo Li, Dane Morgan	2023-08-26 02:37:46	New highly oxygen-active materials may enhance many energy-related technologies by enabling efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures, e.g., below 400 Celsius. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to realize such performance but have received far less attention than vacancy-mediated conductors. Here, we combine physically-motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations, and experiments to demonstrate an approach to discover new fast interstitial oxygen conductors. Multiple new families were found which adopt completely different structures from known oxygen conductors. From these families, we synthesized and studied oxygen kinetics in La4Mn5Si4O22+d (LMS), a representative member of perrierite/chevkinite family. We found LMS has higher oxygen ionic conductivity than the widely used yttria-stabilized ZrO2, and among the highest surface oxygen exchange rates at intermediate temperature of known materials. The fast oxygen kinetics is the result of simultaneously active interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion pathways. This work developed and demonstrated a powerful approach for discovering new families of interstitial oxygen conductors and suggests many more such materials remain to be discovered.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13734v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Uniform Oxygen Doping Leads to Superconductivity in FeTe Films	Mao Zheng	Hefei Hu, Can Zhang, Brian Mulcahy, Jianmin Zuo, James Eckstein	2013-01-20 21:46:05	FeTe is known to become a superconductor when doped with oxygen. Using layer by layer growth of single crystal films by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we have studied how oxygen incorporates. If oxygen is supplied during growth of a layer, it substitutes for tellurium inhomogeneously in oxygen domains that are not associated with superconductivity. When oxygen is supplied after growth, it diffuses homogeneously into the crystalline film and incorporates interstitially. Only the interstitial oxygen causes superconductivity to emerge. This suggests that the superconductivity observed in this material is spatially uniform and not filamentary.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4696v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Bonding, Conductance and Magnetization of Oxygenated Au Nanowires	Chun Zhang	R. N. Barnett, Uzi Landman	2013-11-22 11:48:38	Spin-density-functional calculations of tip-suspended gold chains, with molecular oxygen, or dissociated oxygen atoms, incorporated in them, reveal structural transitions for varying lengths. The nanowires exhibit enhanced strength for both oxygen incorporation modes, and upon stretching tip atoms join the wire. With incorporated molecular oxygen the wire conductance is about 1(2e2/h), transforming to an insulating state beyond a critical length. The nanowire conductance with embedded oxygen atoms is low, 0.2 (2e2/h), and it develops magnetic moments localized on the oxygens and the neighboring Au atoms.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.046801	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Hydrogen/nitrogen/oxygen defect complexes in silicon from computational
  searches"	Andrew J. Morris	Chris J. Pickard, R. J. Needs	2009-08-12 09:45:39	Point defect complexes in crystalline silicon composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are studied within density-functional theory (DFT). Ab initio Random Structure Searching (AIRSS) is used to find low-energy defect structures. We find new lowest-energy structures for several defects: the triple-oxygen defect, {3O}, triple oxygen with a nitrogen atom, {N, 3O}, triple nitrogen with an oxygen atom, {3N,O}, double hydrogen and an oxygen atom, {2H,O}, double hydrogen and oxygen atoms, {2H,2O} and four hydrogen/nitrogen/oxygen complexes, {H,N,O}, {2H,N,O}, {H,2N,O} and {H,N,2O}. We find that some defects form analogous structures when an oxygen atom is replaced by a NH group, for example, {H,N,2O} and {3O}, and {H,N} and {O}. We compare defect formation energies obtained using different oxygen chemical potentials and investigate the relative abundances of the defects.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.144112	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Strain Control of Oxygen Vacancies in Epitaxial Strontium Cobaltite
  Films"	Jonathan R. Petrie	Chandrima Mitra, Hyoungjeen Jeen, Woo Seok Choi, Tricia L. Meyer, Fernando A. Reboredo, John W. Freeland, Gyula Eres, Ho Nyung Lee	2016-02-13 03:31:33	The ability to manipulate oxygen anion defects rather than metal cations in complex oxides can facilitate creating new functionalities critical for emerging energy and device technologies. However, the difficulty in activating oxygen at reduced temperatures hinders the deliberate control of important defects, oxygen vacancies. Here, strontium cobaltite (SrCoOx) is used to demonstrate that epitaxial strain is a powerful tool for manipulating the oxygen vacancy concentration even under highly oxidizing environments and at annealing temperatures as low as 300 C. By applying a small biaxial tensile strain (2%), the oxygen activation energy barrier decreases by ~30%, resulting in a tunable oxygen deficient steady-state under conditions that would normally fully oxidize unstrained cobaltite. These strain-induced changes in oxygen stoichiometry drive the cobaltite from a ferromagnetic metal towards an antiferromagnetic insulator. The ability to decouple the oxygen vacancy concentration from its typical dependence on the operational environment is useful for effectively designing oxides materials with a specific oxygen stoichiometry.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201504868	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Factors controlling oxygen migration barriers in perovskites	Tam Mayeshiba	Dane Morgan	2016-09-12 15:50:33	Perovskites with fast oxygen ion conduction can enable technologies like solid oxide fuel cells. One component of fast oxygen ion conduction is low oxygen migration barrier. Here we apply ab initio methods on over 40 perovskites to produce a database of oxygen migration barriers ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 eV. Mining the database revealed that systems with low barriers also have low metal-oxygen bond strength, as measured by oxygen vacancy formation energy and oxygen p-band center energy. These correlations provide a powerful descriptor for the development of new oxygen ion conductors and may explain the poor stability of some of the best oxygen conducting perovskites under reducing conditions. Other commonly-cited measures of space, volume, or structure ideality showed only weak correlation with migration barrier. The lowest migration barriers (< 0.5 eV) belong to perovskites with non-transition-metal B-site cations, and may require vacancy-creation strategies that involve no dopants or low-association dopants for optimal performance.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssi.2016.09.007	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Singlet Oxygen Generation as a Major Cause for Parasitic Reactions
  during Cycling of Aprotic Lithium-Oxygen Batteries"	Nika Mahne	Bettina Schafzahl, Christian Leypold, Mario Leypold, Sandra Grumm, Anita Leitgeb, Gernot A. Strohmeier, Martin Wilkening, Olivier Fontaine, Denis Kramer, Christian Slugovc, Sergey M. Borisov, Stefan A. Freunberger	2017-11-28 15:22:07	Non-aqueous metal-oxygen batteries depend critically on the reversible formation/decomposition of metal oxides on cycling. Irreversible parasitic reactions cause poor rechargeability, efficiency, and cycle life and have predominantly been ascribed to the reactivity of reduced oxygen species with cell components. These species, however, cannot fully explain the side reactions. Here we show that singlet oxygen forms at the cathode of a lithium-oxygen cell during discharge and from the onset of charge, and accounts for the majority of parasitic reaction products. The amount increases during discharge, early stages of charge, and charging at higher voltages, and is enhanced by the presence of trace water. Superoxide and peroxide appear to be involved in singlet oxygen generation. Singlet oxygen traps and quenchers can reduce parasitic reactions effectively. Awareness of the highly reactive singlet oxygen in non-aqueous metal-oxygen batteries gives a rationale for future research towards achieving highly reversible cell operation.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2017.36	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Factors controlling oxygen interstitial diffusion in the
  Ruddlesden-Popper oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+delta"	Shenzhen Xu	Ryan Jacobs, Dane Morgan	2018-10-11 19:12:13	The development of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxides as oxygen exchange and transport materials will benefit from mechanistic understanding of how oxygen transports through these materials. Using Density Functional Theory, we found there are two distinct oxygen interstitial diffusion mechanisms involving two different oxygen interstitial species that can be active in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta, and, we believe, in hyperstoichiometric RP oxides in general. The first mechanism is the previously proposed interstitialcy-mediated mechanism, which consists of diffusing oxide interstitials. The second mechanism is newly discovered in this work, and consists of both oxide and peroxide interstitial species. This mechanism exhibits a similar or possibly lower migration barrier than the interstitialcy mechanism for high oxidation states. Which mechanism contributes to the oxygen interstitial diffusion is the result of the change in relative stability between the oxide interstitial and peroxide interstitial. The stability of the oxide and peroxide, and the competition between the two oxygen diffusion mechanisms, is sensitive to the overall oxidation state of the system. Therefore, the oxygen diffusion mechanism is a function of the material composition, oxygen off-stoichiometry, operating temperature and oxygen partial pressure. We also examined the effect of epitaxial strain on both oxygen diffusion mechanisms, and found that tensile and compressive epitaxial strain of up to 2% had less than 100 meV/(% strain) effects on oxygen interstitial formation, migration, and activation energies, and that total achievable activation energy reductions are likely less than 100 meV for -2% to +2% epitaxial strain. The presented understanding of factors governing interstitial oxygen diffusion has significant implications for the engineering of RP oxides in numerous alternative energy technologies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05209v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Physical properties and band structure of reactive molecular beam
  epitaxy grown oxygen engineered HfO$_{2\pm x}$"	Erwin Hildebrandt	Jose Kurian, Lambert Alff	2012-11-22 07:00:25	We have conducted a detailed thin film growth structure of oxygen engineered monoclinic HfO$_{2\pm x}$ grown by reactive molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The oxidation conditions induce a switching between ($\bar{1}11$) and (002) texture of hafnium oxide. The band gap of oxygen deficient hafnia decreases with increasing amount of oxygen vacancies by more than 1 eV. For high oxygen vacancy concentrations, defect bands form inside the band gap that induce optical transitions and $p$-type conductivity. The resistivity changes by several orders of magnitude as a function of oxidation conditions. Oxygen vacancies do not give rise to ferromagnetic behavior.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4767379	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Deciphering mechanisms of enhanced-retarded oxygen diffusion in doped Si	Dilyara Timerkaeva	Damien Caliste, Pascal Pochet	2013-10-10 10:38:31	In this letter, we study enhanced-retarded diffusion of oxygen in doped silicon by means of first principle calculations. We found that the migration of oxygen dimers can not be significantly affected by strain, doping type or rate. We attribute the enhanced oxygen diffusion in p-doped silicon to reduced monomer migration energy, and the retarded oxygen diffusion in Sb-doped to oxygen trapping close to a dopant site. The two proposed kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms can appear at the same time and might lead to contradictory experimental results. Such mechanisms can be involved in the light induced degradation phenomenon in solar grade silicon.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4855415	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Oxygen and nitrogen abundances in nearby galaxies. Correlations between
  oxygen abundance and macroscopic properties"	L. S. Pilyugin	J. M. Vilchez, T. Contini	2004-07-01 08:31:47	We performed a compilation of more than 1000 published spectra of HII regions in spiral galaxies. The oxygen and nitrogen abundances in each HII region were recomputed in a homogeneous way, using the P-method. The radial distributions of oxygen and nitrogen abundances were derived. The correlations between oxygen abundance and macroscopic properties are examined. There is a significant difference between the L-Z relationship obtained here and that based on the oxygen abundances determined through the R_23-calibrations. The oxygen abundance of NGC 5457 recently determined using direct measurements of Te (Kennicutt, Bresolin & Garnett 2003) agrees with the L-Z relationship derived here, but is in conflict with the L-Z relationship derived with the R_23-based oxygen abundances. The obtained L-Z relation for spirals is compared to that for irregulars. Our sample of galaxies shows evidence that the slope of the O/H-M_B relationship for spirals is slightly more shallow than that for irregulars. The effective oxygen yields were estimated for spiral and irregular galaxies. The effective oxygen yield increases with increasing luminosity from M_B=-11 to M_B=-18 (or with increasing rotation velocity from Vrot=10 km/s to Vrot=100 km/s) and then remains approximately constant. Irregular galaxies from our sample have effective oxygen yields lowered by a factor of 3 at maximum, i.e. irregular galaxies usually keep at least 1/3 of the oxygen they manufactured during their evolution.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20034522	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Insight into the Role of Oxygen in Phase-Change Material GeTe	Linggang Zhu	Zhen Li, Jian Zhou, Naihua Miao, Zhimei Sun	2016-12-22 07:23:36	"Oxygen is widely used to tune the performance of chalcogenide phase-change materials in the usage of phase-Change random access memory (PCRAM) which is considered as the most promising next-generation non-volatile memory. However, the microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible phase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change materials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work unravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main finding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization process simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom out of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the Te vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a ""dumbbell-like"" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of ab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to substitute Te in crystalline GeTe. This specific defect configuration is found to be responsible for the slower crystallization speed and hence the improved data retention of oxygen doped GeTe as reported in recent experimental work. Moreover, we find that the oxygen will increase the effective mass of the carrier and thus increases the resistivity of GeTe. Our results unravel the microscopic mechanism of the oxygen-doping optimization of phase-change material GeTe, and the present reported mechanism can be applied to other oxygen doped ternary chalcogenide phase-change materials."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07467v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Selective control of oxygen sublattice stability by epitaxial strain in
  Ruddlesden-Popper films"	Tricia L. Meyer	Lu Jiang, Jaekwang Lee, Mina Yoon, John W. Freeland, Jae Hyuck Jang, Dilpuneet S. Aidhy, Albina Borisevich, Matthew Chisholm, Takeshi Egami, Ho Nyung Lee	2015-08-27 18:58:13	Oxygen-defect control has long been considered an influential tuning knob for producing various property responses in complex oxide films. In addition to physical property changes, modification to the lattice structure, specifically lattice expansion, with increasing oxygen vacancy concentrations has been reported often and has become the convention for oxide materials. However, the current understanding of the lattice behavior in oxygen-deficient films becomes disputable when considering compounds containing different bonding environments or atomic layering. Moreover, tensile strain has recently been discovered to stabilize oxygen vacancies in epitaxial films, which further complicates the interpretation of lattice behavior resulting from their appearance. Here, we report on the selective strain control of oxygen vacancy formation and resulting lattice responses in the layered, Ruddlesden-Popper phases, La1.85Sr0.15CuO4. We found that a drastically reduced Gibbs free energy for oxygen vacancy formation near the typical growth temperature for tensile-strained epitaxial LSCO accounts for the large oxygen non-stoichiometry. Additionally, oxygen vacancies form preferentially in the equatorial position of the CuO2 plane, leading to a lattice contraction, rather than the expected expansion, observed with apical oxygen vacancies. Since oxygen stoichiometry plays a key role in determining the physical properties of many complex oxides, the strong strain coupling of oxygen nonstoichiometry and the unusual structural response reported here can provide new perspectives and understanding to the structure and property relationships of many other functional oxide materials.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4937170	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Characterization of oxygen defects in diamond by means of density
  functional theory calculations"	Gergő Thiering	Adam Gali	2016-06-13 08:56:24	Point defects in diamond are of high interest as candidates for realizing solid state quantum bits, bioimaging agents, or ultrasensitive electric or magnetic field sensors. Various artificial diamond synthesis methods should introduce oxygen contamination in diamond, however, the incorporation of oxygen into diamond crystal and the nature of oxygen-related point defects are largely unknown. Oxygen may be potentially interesting as a source of quantum bits or it may interact with other point defects which are well established solid state qubits. Here we employ plane-wave supercell calculations within density functional theory, in order to characterize the electronic and magneto-optical properties of various oxygen-related defects. Beside the trivial single interstitial and substitutional oxygen defects we also consider their complexes with vacancies and hydrogen atoms. We find that oxygen defects are mostly electrically active and introduce highly correlated orbitals that pose a challenge for density functional theory modeling. Nevertheless, we are able to identify the fingerprints of substitutional oxygen defect, the oxygen-vacancy and oxygen-vacancy-hydrogen complexes in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. We demonstrate that first principles calculations can predict the motional averaging of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of defects that are subject to Jahn-Teller distortion. We show that the high-spin neutral oxygen-vacancy defect exhibits very fast non-radiative decay from its optical excited state that might hinder to apply it as a qubit.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.125202	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Oxygen depletion hypothesis remains controversial: a mathematical model
  of oxygen depletion during FLASH radiation"	Ankang Hu	Rui Qiu, Zhen Wu, Chunyan Li, Hui Zhang, Junli Li	2020-01-29 12:54:13	Background: Experiments have reported low normal tissue toxicities during FLASH radiation, but the mechanism has not been elaborated. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism. The oxygen depletion hypothesis has been introduced and mostly studied qualitatively. Methods: We present a computational model to describe the time-dependent change of oxygen concentration in the tissue. The kinetic equation of the model is solved numerically using the finite difference method. The model is used to analyze the FLASH effect with the oxygen depletion hypothesis, and the brain tissue is chosen as an example. Results: The oxygen distribution is determined by the oxygen consumption rate of the tissue and the distance between capillaries. The change of oxygen concentration with time after radiation has been found to follow a negative exponential function, and the time constant is determined by the distance between capillaries. When the dose rate is high enough, the same dose results in the same change of oxygen concentration regardless of dose rate. The analysis of FLASH effect in the brain tissue based on this model does not support the explanation of the oxygen depletion hypothesis. Conclusions: The oxygen depletion hypothesis remains controversial because oxygen in most normal tissues cannot be depleted by FLASH radiation according to the mathematical analysis with this model and experiments on the expression and distribution of the hypoxia-inducible factors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1667/RADE-20-00260.1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Effect of Oxygen Mole Fraction on Static Properties of
  Pressure-Sensitive Paint"	Tomohiro Okudera	Takayuki Nagata, Miku Kasai, Yuji Saito, Taku Nonomura, Keisuke Asai	2020-12-23 02:37:25	The effects of oxygen mole fraction on the static properties of pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) were investigated. Sample coupon tests using a calibration chamber were conducted for polymer-based PSP (PHFIPM-PSP), polymer/ceramic PSP (PC-PSP), and anodized-aluminium PSP (AA-PSP). The oxygen mole fraction was set to be between 0.1-100% and the ambient pressure was set to be between 0.5-140 kPa. The localized Stern-Volmer coefficient $B_{\rm local}$ once increases and then decreases as the oxygen mole fraction increases. The value of $B_{\rm local}$ depends on both ambient pressure and oxygen mole fraction, but the effect of this parameter can be characterized as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen. The value of $B_{\rm local}$ of AA-PSP and PHFIPM-PSP, which are low-pressure type and relatively low-pressure type PSP, have a peak at the relatively low partial pressure of oxygen, and $B_{\rm local}$ of PC-PSP, which are atmospheric pressure type PSP, has a peak at the relatively high partial pressure of oxygen. The peak of the intensity change with respect to pressure fluctuation proportional to the ambient pressure $S_{\mathcal{PR}}$ appears at the lower partial pressure of oxygen than that of $B_{\rm local}$. This is because the intensity of PSP becomes quite low at the high partial pressure of oxygen even if $B_{\rm local}$ is higher. Hence, an optimal partial oxygen mole fraction exists depending on the type of PSP and ambient pressure range of the experiment, and its optimal value can be found based on the partial pressure of oxygen.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21041062	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks	T. Bensby	S. Feltzing, I. Lundstrom	2003-10-27 07:30:09	We present oxygen abundances for 72 F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. Using the kinematics of the stars we divide them into two sub-samples with space velocities that are typical for the thick and thin disks, respectively. The metallicities of the stars range from [Fe/H] = -0.9 to +0.4 and we use the derived oxygen abundances of the stars to: (1) perform a differential study of the oxygen trends in the thin and the thick disk; (2) to follow the trend of oxygen in the thin disk to the highest metallicities. We analyze the forbidden oxygen lines at 6300 {\AA} and 6363 {\AA} as well as the (NLTE afflicted) triplet lines around 7774 {\AA}. For the forbidden line at 6300 A we have spectra of very high S/N (>400) and resolution (R=215 000). This has enabled a very accurate modeling of the oxygen line and the blending Ni lines. The high internal accuracy in our determination of the oxygen abundances from this line is reflected in the very tight trends we find for oxygen relative to iron........	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20031655	cs	arxiv					0.0

Karppinen	2002-10-30 07:15:07	Here results of a systematic study on oxygen stoichiometry are reported for the first three members of the novel CoSr2(Y,Ce)sCu2O5+2s or Co-12s2 homologous series, i.e. Co-1212, Co-1222 and Co-1232 phases with a SrO-CoO1-SrO-CuO2-(Y,Ce)-[O2-(Y,Ce)]s-1-CuO2 layered structure. The oxygen content was precisely determined by two independent chemical techniques: coulometric Cu+/Cu2+ titration and iodometric titration. Furthermore, oxygen stability/tunability was investigated by means of oxygenative and reductive an-nealings carried out in a thermobalance. It was revealed that all the three phases are rather stoichiometric in oxygen content and stable against both oxygenative and reductive an-nealings. The present results for the Co-12s2 homologous series suggest that not only the CoO1 charge reservoir but also the nominally oxygen-stoichiometric B-[O2-B]s-1 fluo-rite block, that is the characteristic structural element for the Co-12s2 (s > 1) phases and all other layered copper oxides of category-B [H. Yamauchi and M. Karppinen, Superlatt. Microstructr. 21A (1997) 128] is non-tunable in terms of the oxygen content.	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0210660v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Magnetic and superconducting properties of RuSr2 Gd1.5Ce0.5Cu2O10-x
  samples: dependence on the oxygen content and ageing effects"	C. A. Cardoso	A. J. C. Lanfredi, A. J. Chiquito, V. P. S. Awana, H. Kishan, R. L. de Almeida, O. F. de Lima, F. M. Araujo-Moreira	2005-02-28 19:35:35	The magnetic and superconducting properties of RuSr2Gd1.5Ce0.5Cu2O10-x polycrystalline samples with different oxygen doping level are presented. A strong suppression of the superconducting temperature (Tc), as well as a reduction in the superconducting fraction, occurs as the oxygen content is reduced by annealing the samples in oxygen deprived atmospheres. Drastic changes in the electrical resistivity are observed above Tc, possibly associated with oxygen removal mainly from grain boundaries. However, the magnetic ordering is relatively less affected by the changes in oxygen content of the samples. The spin glass transition is enhanced and shifted to higher temperatures with the reduction in oxygen content. This could be correlated with an increase in the spins disorder and frustration for the oxygen depleted samples. Also, the same oxygen vacancy induced disorder could explain the reduction in the fraction of the sample showing antiferromagnetic order. We also report significant changes in the measured properties of the samples as a function of time.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.134509	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Domain formation on oxidized graphene	M. Topsakal	S. Ciraci	2012-10-05 22:31:55	Using first-principles calculations within density functional theory we demonstrate that the adsorption of single oxygen atom results in significant electron transfer from graphene to oxygen. This strongly disturbs the charge landscape of the C-C bonds at the proximity. Additional oxygen atoms adsorbing to graphene prefer always the C-C bonds having highest charge density and consequently they have tendency to form domain structure. While oxygen adsorption to one side of graphene ends with significant buckling, the adsorption to both sides with similar domain pattern is favored. The binding energy displays an oscillatory variation and the band gap widens with increasing oxygen coverage. While a single oxygen atom migrates over the C-C bonds on graphene surface, a repulsive interaction prevents two oxygen adatoms from forming an oxygen molecule. Our first-principles study together with finite temperature ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations concludes that oxygen adatoms on graphene cannot desorb easily without influence of external agents.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.205402	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Localized versus itinerant states created by multiple oxygen vacancies
  in SrTiO3"	Harald O. Jeschke	Juan Shen, Roser Valenti	2014-07-25 21:10:09	Oxygen vacancies in strontium titanate surfaces (SrTiO3) have been linked to the presence of a two-dimensional electron gas with unique behavior. We perform a detailed density functional theory study of the lattice and electronic structure of SrTiO3 slabs with multiple oxygen vacancies, with a main focus on two vacancies near a titanium dioxide terminated SrTiO3 surface. We conclude based on total energies that the two vacancies preferably inhabit the first two layers, i.e. they cluster vertically, while in the direction parallel to the surface, the vacancies show a weak tendency towards equal spacing. Analysis of the nonmagnetic electronic structure indicates that oxygen defects in the surface TiO2 layer lead to population of Ti t2g states and thus itinerancy of the electrons donated by the oxygen vacancy. In contrast, electrons from subsurface oxygen vacancies populate Ti eg states and remain localized on the two Ti ions neighboring the vacancy. We find that both, the formation of a bound oxygen-vacancy state composed of hybridized Ti 3eg and 4p states neighboring the oxygen vacancy as well as the elastic deformation after extracting oxygen contribute to the stabilization of the in-gap state.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023034	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Synthesis of photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride	J. Montero	F. A. Martinsen, M. Lelis, S. Zh. Karazhanov, B. C. Hauback, E. S. Marstein	2016-10-26 10:03:48	Photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride has been synthesized using a two step process. The process consists of an initial sputter deposition of oxygen-free yttrium hydride YH$_\mathrm{x}$, followed by a controlled reaction with air that causes incorporation of oxygen into the material. An in-situ study of the YH$_\mathrm{x}$ as it reacted with oxygen was made possible by applying an aluminium capping layer with a low but non-zero oxygen permeability prior to air exposure. During the reaction, the visual appearance of the YH$_\mathrm{x}$ went from dark and opaque to transparent and yellowish. This transition was accredited incorporation of oxygen into the material, as shown through analysis with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) studies revealed an fcc structure both before and after oxygen exposure, with a lattice parameter that increased from 5.2 {\AA} to 5.4 {\AA} during the reaction. With the lattice parameter in the oxygen free YH$_\mathrm{x}$ being equal to that reported earlier for YH$_\mathrm{2}$, our findings suggest that the non-reacted YH$_\mathrm{x}$ in this study is in-fact YH$_\mathrm{2}$.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2017.02.001	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Electronic effect of doped oxygen atoms in Bi2201 superconductors
  determined by scanning tunneling microscopy"	Ying Fei	Kunliang Bu, Wenhao Zhang, Yuan Zheng, Xuan Sun, Ying Ding, Xingjiang Zhou, Yi Yin	2018-03-09 07:23:43	The oxygen dopants are essential in tuning electronic properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_{n-1}$Cu$_n$O$_{2n+4+\delta}$ superconductors. Here we apply the technique of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study the influence of oxygen dopants in an optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ and an overdoped Bi$_{2-y}$Pb$_y$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. In both samples, we find that interstitial oxygen atoms on the SrO layers dominate over the other two forms of oxygen dopants, oxygen vacancies on the SrO layers and interstitial oxygen atoms on the BiO layers. The hole doping is estimated from the oxygen concentration, as compared to the result extracted from the measured Fermi surface. The precise spatial location is employed to obtain a negative correlation between the oxygen dopants and the inhomogeneous pseudogap.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11433-018-9276-5	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Oxygen vacancies in bulk and at neutral domain walls in hexagonal
  YMnO$_3$"	Sandra H. Skjærvø	Didrik R. Småbråten, Nicola A. Spaldin, Thomas Tybell, Sverre M. Selbach	2018-07-04 10:08:10	We use density functional calculations to investigate the accommodation and migration of oxygen vacancies in bulk hexagonal YMnO$_3$, and to study interactions between neutral ferroelectric domain walls and oxygen vacancies. Our calculations show that oxygen vacancies in bulk YMnO$_3$ are more stable in the Mn-O layers than in the Y-O layers. Migration barriers of the planar oxygen vacancies are high compared to oxygen vacancies in perovskites, and to previously reported values for oxygen interstitials in h-YMnO$_3$. The calculated polarization decreases linearly with vacancy concentration, while the out-of-plane lattice parameter expands in agreement with previous experiments. In contrast with ferroelectric perovskites, oxygen vacancies are found to be more stable in bulk than at domain walls. The tendency of oxygen vacancies to segregate away from neutral domain walls is explained by unfavorable Y-O bond lengths caused by the local strain field at the domain walls.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.184102	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On the oxygen abundance determination in HII regions: the problem of the
  line intensities -- oxygen abundance calibration"	L. S. Pilyugin	Aucun	2000-04-04 06:33:23	"The problem of the line intensities -- oxygen abundance calibration has been considered. We confirm the idea of McGaugh (1991) that the strong oxygen lines ([OII] 3727, 3729 and [OIII] 4959, 5007) contain the necessary information for determination of accurate abundances in low-metallicity (and may be also in high-metallicity) HII regions. It has been found that the excitation parameters p3 or p2 (which are defined here as contributions of the radiation in [OIII] 4959, 5007 lines and in [OII] 3727, 3729 lines to the ""total"" oxygen radiation respectively) allow to take into account the variations in R23 values among HII regions with a given oxygen abundance. Based on this fact a new way of the oxygen abundance determination in HII regions has been constructed and corresponding relations between line intensities and the oxygen abundance have been derived empirically using the available oxygen abundances determined via measurement of temperature-sensitive line ratios.   In parallel a new R23 calibration has been derived on the base of recent data and compared to previous calibrations. For oxygen-rich HII regions the present R23 calibration is close to that of Edmunds and Pagel (1984): their calibration has the same slope but is shifted towards higher oxygen abundances by around 0.07 dex as compared to the present calibration."	http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0004032v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Boundaries of the Peruvian Oxygen Minimum Zone shaped by coherent
  mesoscale dynamics"	João H. Bettencourt	Cristóbal López, Emilio Hernández García, Ivonne Montes, Joël Sudre, Boris Dewitte, Aurélien Paulmier, Véronique Garçon	2015-06-13 16:55:32	Dissolved oxygen in sea water is a major factor affecting marine habitats and biogeochemical cycles. Oceanic zones with oxygen deficits represent significant portions of the area and volume of the oceans and are thought to be expanding. The Peruvian oxygen minimum zone is one of the most pronounced and lies in a region of strong mesoscale activity in the form of vortices and frontal regions, whose effect in the dynamics of the oxygen minimum zone is largely unknown. Here, we study this issue from a modeling approach and a Lagrangian point of view, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical simulation of the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone and finite-size Lyapunov exponent fields to understand the link between mesoscale dynamics and oxygen variations. Our results show that, at depths between 380 and 600 meters, mesoscale structures have a relevant dual role. First, their mean positions and paths delimit and maintain the oxygen minimum zone boundaries. Second, their high frequency fluctuations entrain oxygen across these boundaries as eddy fluxes that point towards the interior of the oxygen minimum zone and are one order of magnitude larger than mean fluxes. We conclude that these eddy fluxes contribute to the ventilation of the oxygen minimum zone.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2570	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Channels of oxygen diffusion in single crystal rubrene revealed	Robert J. Thompson	Thomas Bennett, Sarah Fearn, Muhammad Kamaludin, Christian Kloc, David S. McPhail, Oleg Mitrofanov, Neil J. Curson	2016-03-14 10:40:16	Electronic devices made from organic materials have the potential to support a more ecologically friendly and affordable future. However, the ability to fabricate devices with well-defined and reproducible electrical and optical properties is hindered by the sensitivity to the presence of chemical impurities. Oxygen in particular is an impurity that can trap electrons and modify conductive properties of some organic materials. Until now the 3-dimensional profiling of oxygen species in organic semiconductors has been elusive and the effect of oxygen remains disputed. In this study we map out high-spatial resolution 3-dimensional distributions of oxygen inclusions near the surface of single crystal rubrene, using Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). Channels of diffused oxygen, 'oxygen pillars', are found extending from uniform oxygen inclusion layers at the surface. These pillars extend to depths in excess of 1.8 {\mu}m and act as an entry point for oxygen to diffuse along the ab-plane of the crystal with at least some of the diffused oxygen molecularly binding to rubrene. Our investigation of surfaces at different stages of evolution reveals the extent of oxygen inclusion, which affects rubrene's optical and transport properties, and is consequently of importance for the reliability and longevity of devices.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C6CP05369F	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Measuring oxygen abundances from stellar spectra without oxygen lines	Yuan-Sen Ting	Charlie Conroy, Hans-Walter Rix, Martin Asplund	2018-01-23 02:00:01	"Oxygen is the most abundant ""metal"" element in stars and in the cosmos. But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging, because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000) optical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves."	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aac6c9	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Assessing correlations of perovskite catalytic performance with
  electronic structure descriptors"	Ryan Jacobs	Jonathan Hwang, Yang Shao-Horn, Dane Morgan	2019-02-15 16:10:16	Electronic structure descriptors are computationally efficient quantities used to construct qualitative correlations for a variety of properties. In particular, the oxygen p-band center has been used to guide material discovery and fundamental understanding of an array of perovskite compounds for use in catalyzing the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. However, an assessment of the effectiveness of the oxygen p-band center at predicting key measures of perovskite catalytic activity has not been made, and would be highly beneficial to guide future predictions and codify best practices. Here, we have used Density Functional Theory at the PBE, PBEsol, PBE+U, SCAN and HSE06 levels to assess the correlations of numerous measures of catalytic performance for a series of technologically relevant perovskite oxides, using the bulk oxygen p-band center as an electronic structure descriptor. We have analyzed correlations of the calculated oxygen p-band center for all considered functionals with the experimentally measured X-ray emission spectroscopy oxygen p-band center and multiple measures of catalytic activity, including high temperature oxygen reduction surface exchange rates, aqueous oxygen evolution current densities, and binding energies of oxygen evolution intermediate species. Our results show that the best correlations for all measures of catalytic activity considered here are made with PBE-level calculations, with strong observed linear correlations with the bulk oxygen p-band center (R2 = 0.81-0.87). This study shows that strong linear correlations between numerous important measures of catalytic activity and the oxygen p-band bulk descriptor can be obtained under a consistent computational framework, and these correlations can serve as a guide for future experiments and simulations for development of perovskite and related oxide catalysts.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03840	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The oxygen abundance gradients in the gas discs of galaxies in the EAGLE
  simulation"	Patricia B. Tissera	Yetli Rosas-Guevara, Richard G. Bower, Robert A. Crain, Claudia del P. Lagos, Matthieu Schaller, Joop Schaye, Tom Theuns	2018-06-12 14:53:55	We use the EAGLE simulations to study the oxygen abundance gradients of gas discs in galaxies within the stellar mass range [10^9.5, 10^10.8]Mo at z=0. The estimated median oxygen gradient is -0.011 (0.002) dex kpc^-1, which is shallower than observed. No clear trend between simulated disc oxygen gradient and galaxy stellar mass is found when all galaxies are considered. However, the oxygen gradient shows a clear correlation with gas disc size so that shallower abundance slopes are found for increasing gas disc sizes. Positive oxygen gradients are detected for ~40 per cent of the analysed gas discs, with a slight higher frequency in low mass galaxies. Galaxies that have quiet merger histories show a positive correlation between oxygen gradient and stellar mass, so that more massive galaxies tend to have shallower metallicity gradients. At high stellar mass, there is a larger fraction of rotational-dominated galaxies in low density regions. At low stellar mass, non-merger galaxies show a large variety of oxygen gradients and morphologies. The normalization of the disc oxygen gradients in non-merger galaxies by the effective radius removes the trend with stellar mass. Conversely, galaxies that experienced mergers show a weak relation between oxygen gradient and stellar mass. Additionally, the analysed EAGLE discs show no clear dependence of the oxygen gradients on local environment, in agreement with current observational findings.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty2817	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Chemical Evolution of Irregular and Blue Compact Galaxies	L. Carigi	P. Colin, M. Peimbert, A. Sarmiento	1994-11-28 22:51:25	We discuss the chemical evolution of metal poor galaxies and conclude that their oxygen deficiency is not due to: the production of black holes by massive stars or a varying slope of the Initial Mass Function, IMF, at the high-mass end. A varying IMF at the low-mass end alone or in combination with: (a) an outflow of oxygen-rich material, (b) an outflow of well-mixed material, and (c) the presence of dark matter that does not participate in the chemical evolution process, is needed to explain their oxygen deficiency. Outflow of material rich in oxygen helps to account for the large helium to oxygen mass ratio values derived from these objects, but it works against explaining the carbon to oxygen mass ratio and the heavy elements minus carbon and oxygen to oxygen mass ratio values.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/175675	cs	arxiv					0.0

Isern	2004-08-12 17:53:11	We explore the adiabatic pulsational properties of massive white dwarf stars with hydrogen-rich envelopes and oxygen/neon and carbon/oxygen cores. To this end, we compute the cooling of massive white dwarf models for both core compositions taking into account the evolutionary history of the progenitor stars and the chemical evolution caused by time-dependent element diffusion. In particular, for the oxygen/neon models, we adopt the chemical profile resulting from repeated carbon-burning shell flashes expected in very massive white dwarf progenitors. For carbon/oxygen white dwarfs we consider the chemical profiles resulting from phase separation upon crystallization. For both compositions we also take into account the effects of crystallization on the oscillation eigenmodes. We find that the pulsational properties of oxygen/neon white dwarfs are notably different from those made of carbon/oxygen, thus making asteroseismological techniques a promising way to distinguish between both types of stars and, hence, to obtain valuable information about their progenitors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20040416	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Study of Oxygen Diffusion and Clustering in Silicon using an Empirical
  Interatomic Potential"	Z. Jiang	R. A. Brown	1995-04-25 14:51:25	The diffusion path and diffusivity of oxygen in crystalline silicon are computed using an empirical interatomic potential which was recently developed for modelling the interactions between oxygen and silicon atoms. The diffusion path is determined by constrained energy minimization, and the diffusivity is computed using jump rate theory. The calculated diffusivity is in excellent agreement with experiemental data. The same interatomic potntial also is used to study the formation of small clusters of oxygen atoms in silicon. The structures of these clusters are found by NPT molecular dynamics simulations, and their free energies are calculated by thermodynamic integration. These free energies are used to predict the temperature dependence of the equilibrium partitioning of oxygen into clusters of different sizes. The calculations show that, for given total oxygen concentration, most oxygen atoms are in clusters at temperature below 1300K, and that the average cluster size increases with decreasing temperature. These results are in qualitative agreement with effects of thermal annealing on oxygen precipitation in silicon crystals.	http://arxiv.org/abs/mtrl-th/9504001v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Oxygen-vacancy-induced charge carrier in n-type interface of LaAlO3
  overlayer on SrTiO3 (001): interface vs bulk doping carrier"	Yun Li	S. Na Phattalung, S. Limpijumnong, Jaejun Yu	2009-12-24 10:22:14	We investigated the role of oxygen vacancy in n-type interface of LaAlO3 (LAO) overlayer on SrTiO3 (STO) (001) by carrying out density-functional-theory calculations. Comparing the total energies of the configurations with one vacancy in varying locations we found that oxygen vacancies favor to appear first in LAO surface. These oxygen vacancies in the surface generate a two-dimensional distribution of carriers at the interface, resulting in band bending at the interface in STO side. Dependent on the concentration of oxygen vacancies in LAO surface, the induced carrier charge at the interface partially or completely compensates the polar electric field in LAO. Moreover, the electronic properties of oxygen vacancies in STO are also presented. Every oxygen vacancy in STO generates two electron carriers, but this carrier charge has no effect on screening polar field in LAO. Band structures at the interface dependent on the concentrations of oxygen vacancies are presented and compared with experimental results.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4805v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Role of oxygen-oxygen hopping in the three-band copper-oxide model:
  quasiparticle weight, metal insulator and magnetic phase boundaries, gap
  values and optical conductivity"	Xin Wang	Luca de' Medici, Andrew J. Millis	2010-09-17 19:44:35	We investigate the effect of oxygen-oxygen hopping on the three-band copper-oxide model relevant to high-$T_c$ cuprates, finding that the physics is changed only slightly as the oxygen-oxygen hopping is varied. The location of the metal-insulator phase boundary in the plane of interaction strength and charge transfer energy shifts by $\sim 0.5$eV or less along the charge transfer axis, the quasiparticle weight has approximately the same magnitude and doping dependence and the qualitative characteristics of the electron-doped and hole-doped sides of the phase diagram do not change. The results confirm the identification of La$_2$CuO$_4$ as a material with intermediate correlation strength. However, the magnetic phase boundary as well as higher-energy features of the optical spectrum are found to depend on the magnitude of the oxygen-oxygen hopping. We compare our results to previously published one-band and three-band model calculations.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.83.094501	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Thermodynamic stability of oxygen point defects in cubic Zirconia	Amit Samanta	Thomas Lenosky, Ju Li	2010-09-28 13:44:19	Zirconia (ZrO2) is an important material with technological applications which are affected by point defect physics. Ab-initio calculations are performed to understand the structural and electronic properties of oxygen vacancies and interstitials in different charge states in cubic zirconia. We find oxygen interstitials in cubic ZrO2 can have five different configurations - <110> dumbbell, <100> dumbbell, <100> crowd-ion, octahedral, and <111> distorted dumbbell. For a neutral and singly charged oxygen interstitial, the lowest energy configuration is the <110> dumbbell, while for a doubly charged oxygen interstitial the octahedral site is energetically the most favorable. Both the oxygen interstitial and the oxygen vacancy are negative-U, so that the singly charged defects are unstable at any Fermi level. The thermodynamic stability of these defects are studied in terms of Fermi level, oxygen partial pressure and temperature. A method to determine the chemical potential of the system as a function of temperature and pressure is proposed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5567v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Optimum oxygen content in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films	Yu. M. Nikolaenko	V. N. Varyukhin, Yu. V. Medvedev, N. B. Efros, I. V. Zhikharev, S. V. Kara-Murza, A. A. Tikhii	2011-11-29 14:25:08	The technological conditions of oxygen content variation in epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} films and the peculiarities of change of their transport characteristics were investigated. The films were grown onto single crystal SrTiO3 substrates by an enhanced method of dc magnetron sputtering of a ceramic target. It was revealed, that the oxygen content of the film material with initially strong deviation from stoichiometric composition ({\delta}>0.06) changes easily in both directions at temperatures Tp >=870 K, and the result of the oxygen content variation can be well controlled via changes of conductivity minimum temperature (Tm). The particularities of indirect accurate control of the oxygen content in the film are described. The existence of oxygen-excessive composition of the film is in principal agreement with the known phase diagrams for a powder samples. It was revealed, the oxygen-excessive content of the film causes the increase of free charge carriers concentration and the decrease of the film conductivity in ferromagnetic state. It is shown, that the oxygen-deficient films can demonstrate the same peculiarity of magnetotransport properties as the films with a deviation from stoichiometric content in cation composition.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7180v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A new investigation of oxygen flow influence on ITO thin films by

It was found that the optical absorption decreases and optical absorption edge has blue shifts with the increasing oxygen flow rate. Oxygen vacancy concentration was characterized and analyzed by XPS. It is shown that the oxygen vacancy concentration increases with oxygen flow rates, which is a different observation from the current understanding. The energy band structures associated with different vacancy concentrations of ITO were calculated using the first-principle based on density functional theory. The calculation results show that the increase of oxygen vacancies induces the increase of bands below Fermi level as well as the presence of a second band gap, which accounts for effects of the oxygen vacancies on the blue shifts.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5943v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Single-cell measurement of red blood cell oxygen affinity	Di Caprio	Chris Stokes, John M. Higgins, Ethan Schonbrun	2015-05-12 15:42:09	Oxygen is transported throughout the body by hemoglobin in red blood cells. While the oxygen affinity of blood is well understood and is routinely assessed in patients by pulse oximetry, variability at the single-cell level has not been previously measured. In contrast, single-cell measurements of red blood cell volume and hemoglobin concentration are taken millions of times per day by clinical hematology analyzers and are important factors in determining the health of the hematologic system. To better understand the variability and determinants of oxygen affinity on a cellular level, we have developed a system that quantifies the oxygen saturation, cell volume and hemoglobin concentration for individual red blood cells in high-throughput. We find that the variability in single-cell saturation peaks at an oxygen partial pressure of 2.5%, which corresponds to the maximum slope of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. In addition, single-cell oxygen affinity is positively correlated with hemoglobin concentration, but independent of osmolarity, which suggests variation in the hemoglobin to 2-3 DPG ratio on a cellular level. By quantifying the functional behavior of a cellular population, our system adds a new dimension to blood cell analysis and other measurements of single-cell variability.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04119v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The effects of oxygen in spinel oxide Li1+xTi2-xO4-delta thin films	Yanli Jia	Ge He, Wei Hu, Hua Yang, Zhenzhong Yang, Heshan Yu, Qinghua Zhang, Jinan Shi, Zefeng Lin, Jie Yuan, Beiyi Zhu, Lin Gu, Hong Li, Kui Jin	2017-06-23 09:48:53	The evolution from superconducting LiTi2O4-delta to insulating Li4Ti5O12 thin films has been studied by precisely adjusting the oxygen pressure during the sample fabrication process. In the superconducting LiTi2O4-delta films, with the increase of oxygen pressure, the oxygen vacancies are filled, and the c-axis lattice constant decreases gradually. With the increase of the oxygen pressure to a certain critical value, the c-axis lattice constant becomes stable, which implies that the Li4Ti5O12 phase comes into being. The process of oxygen filling is manifested by the angular bright-field images of the scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. The temperature of magnetoresistance changed from positive and negative shows a non-monotonous behavior with the increase of oxygen pressure. The theoretical explanation of the oxygen effects on the structure and superconductivity of LiTi2O4-delta has also been discussed in this work.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07618v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

The 60CPO-40PSFAO membrane still exhibits simultaneously excellent oxygen permeability and phase stability after operating for over 100 h at air/CO2 condition at 1000 {\deg}C, which further indicates that the 60CPO-40PSFAO composite is likely to be used for oxygen supply in CO2 capture	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.07.281	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Enhancing Perovskite Electrocatalysis through Strain Tuning of the
  Oxygen Deficiency"	Jonathan R. Petrie	Hyoungjeen Jeen, Sara C. Barron, Tricia L. Meyer, Ho Nyung Lee	2016-06-07 18:40:30	Oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides facilitate catalysis critical for energy storage and generation. However, it has proven elusive to promote vacancies at the lower temperatures required for operation in devices such as metal-air batteries and portable fuel cells. Here, we use thin films of the perovskite-based strontium cobaltite (SrCoOx) to show that epitaxial strain is a powerful tool towards manipulating the oxygen content under conditions consistent with the oxygen evolution reaction, yielding increasingly oxygen deficient states in an environment where the cobaltite would normally be fully oxidized. The additional oxygen vacancies created through tensile strain enhance the cobaltite catalytic activity towards this important reaction by over an order of magnitude, equaling that of precious metal catalysts, including IrO2. Our findings demonstrate that strain in these oxides can dictate oxygen stoichiometry independent of ambient conditions, allowing unprecedented control over oxygen vacancies essential in catalysis near room temperature.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.6b03520	cs	arxiv					0.0

  and Ceria: II. Mapping Electrode Polarization and Vacancy Condensation in YSZ"	Yanhao Dong	I-Wei Chen	2017-10-04 14:42:44	Knowing the correlation between grain boundary mobility and oxygen potential in yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), we have utilized the grain size as a microstructural marker to map local oxygen potential. Abrupt oxygen potential transition is established under a large current density and in thicker samples. Cathodically depressed oxygen potential can be easily triggered by poor electrode kinetics or in an oxygen-lean environment. Widespread cavitation in the presence of highly reducing oxygen potential suggests oxygen vacancy condensation instead of oxygen bubble formation as commonly assumed for solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells. These results also suggest electrode kinetics has a direct influence on the microstructure and properties of ceramics sintered under a large electric current.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jace.15274	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Reaction front occurrence on imperfection profiles during oxygen
  chemical diffusion in oxides. II. Kinetic analysis"	Misha Sinder	Zeev Burshtein, Joshua Pelleg	2018-06-05 14:16:26	We present a theoretical study of the impact of oxygen diffusion in oxide crystals on metal dopants ionic state and the conduction type under dynamic changes. The slow changes under thermal equilibrium are provided in a companion, Part I paper. Oxygen vacancy formation acting as a shallow, double-electronic donor, is assumed to result from the crystal exposure to a low ambient oxygen pressure. Critical transitions from n- to a p-type at an oxygen partial pressure Pi, and in ionization state of the metal dopant at an oxygen partial pressure PM, are usually not simultaneous, and depend on the different reaction constants. Invoking ambipolar diffusion for all participating species, it is shown that oxygen vacancy diffusion exhibits well defined characteristics in specific regions of the vacancy concentration related to the said critical pressures. Particularly, the oxygen chemical diffusivity is practically constant between Pi and PM, and increases sharply for pressures P << Pi,PM and P >> P,PM. Prominent reaction fronts occur under specific conditions in the two latter regions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01706v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Cluster Catalysis with Lattice Oxygen: Tracing Oxygen Transport from a
  Magnetite(001) Support onto Small Pt Clusters"	Sebastian Kaiser	Farahnaz Maleki, Ke Zhang, Wolfgang Harbich, Ueli Heiz, Sergio Tosoni, Barbara A. J. Lechner, Gianfranco Pacchioni, Friedrich Esch	2021-03-30 15:10:55	Oxidation catalysis on reducible oxide-supported small metal clusters often involves lattice oxygen. In the present work, we trace the path of lattice oxygen from Fe3O4(001) onto small Pt clusters during the CO oxidation, aiming at differentiating whether the reaction takes place at the cluster/support interface or on the cluster. While oxygen vacancies form on many other supports, magnetite maintains its surface stoichiometry upon reduction thanks to a high cation mobility. In order to investigate whether size-dependent oxygen affinities play a role, we study two specific cluster sizes, Pt5 and Pt19. By separating different reaction steps in our experiment, lattice oxygen can be accumulated on the clusters. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and sophisticated pulsed valve experiments indicate that the CO oxidation takes place on the Pt clusters rather than at the interface. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) shows a decrease in apparent height of the clusters, which density functional theory (DFT) explains as a restructuring following lattice oxygen reverse spillover.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.1c01451	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Unexpected Spontaneously Dynamic Oxygen Migration on Carbon Nanotubes	Guangdong Zhu	Zhijing Huang, Liang Zhao, Yusong Tu	2021-05-09 09:30:20	Using the density functional theory calculations, we show that the oxygen functional groups exhibit unexpected spontaneously dynamic behaviors on the interior surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Two types of dynamic oxygen migrations - hydroxyl and epoxy migrations - are achieved by the breaking/reforming of C-O bond reaction and the proton transfer reaction. It is demonstrated that the spontaneously dynamic characteristic is attributed to the sharply reduced energy barrier less than or comparable to thermal fluctuations. We also observe a stable intermediate state with a dangling C-O bond, which permits the successive migration of oxygen functional groups. However, on the exterior surface of SWCNT, the oxygen groups are difficult to migrate spontaneously due to the relatively high energy barriers, and the dangling C-O bond prefers to transform into the more stable epoxy configuration. The spontaneous oxygen migration is further confirmed by the long-distance oxygen migration, which comprises three hydroxyl migration reactions and one C-O bond reaction. Our work provides a new understanding of the behavior of oxygen functional groups on interfaces and gives a potential route to design new carbon-based dynamic materials.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1nr03251h	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Noble-Metal-Assisted Fast Interfacial Oxygen Migration with Topotactic
  Phase Transition in Perovskite Oxides"	Qian Wang	Youdi Gu, Wenxuan Zhu, Lei Han, Feng Pan, Cheng Song	2021-11-01 02:34:59	Transition-metal perovskite oxides constitute a series of functional material systems for electronics, catalysis and energy-conversion processes, in which oxygen migration and evolution play a key role. However, the stable metal-oxygen (M-O) bond forms large energy barrier inhibiting ion diffusion. Therefore, seeking efficient and facile approaches to accelerate oxygen kinetics has become a significant issue. Here, the interaction (interfacial charge transfer and cooperative bonding) between noble metal (Pt, Ag) and perovskites oxide (SrCoO3-delta) is employed to weaken (M-O) bond and decrease the energy barrier of oxygen migration. Noble metal layers serving as oxygen pumps can continuously extract oxygen from oxide films to atmosphere. The temperature of topotactic phase transition from perovskite (SrCoO3) to brownmillerite (SrCoO2.5) is remarkably lowered from 200 K to room temperature. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to SrFeO3 for similar topotactic phase reduction by moderate thermal activation. Our finding paves a promising and general pathway to achieve fast oxygen migration in perovskite oxides, with important application prospect in low-temperature electrodes and high-activity catalysis interface.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202106765	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Computational Understandings of the Cation Configuration Dependent Redox
  Activities and Oxygen Dimerizations in Li$_{1.22}$Ni$_{0.22}$Mn$_{0.56}$O$_2$
  Cathode"	Zhenming Xu	Yongyao Xia, Mingbo Zheng	2022-04-08 00:25:36	Understanding the lattice oxygen dimerization is quite essential for the optimal design for the Li-rich Mn-based cathode materials. In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a Ni-honeycomb Li-Ni-Mn cation configuration for Li$_{1.22}$Ni$_{0.22}$Mn$_{0.56}$O$_2$ cathode was carefully proposed and examined, which can coexist with the well-known Li-honeycomb structure in the experimentally synthesized Li$_{1.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Mn$_{0.6}$O$_2$ samples. Li-Ni-Mn cation configurations have significant impacts on oxygen redox activities and oxygen dimerizations in the delithiated Li$_x$Ni$_{0.22}$Mn$_{0.56}$O$_2$. There is no necessary consistency between the high lattice oxygen redox activity and easy oxygen dimerization, such as the Li-honeycomb structures showing higher redox activities and higher activation energy barriers to prohibit oxygen dimerizations than Ni-honeycomb structures. Avoiding the Ni-honeycomb structures with more favorable lattice oxygen dimerization and making full use of the Li-honeycomb structures with better redox activities is important to optimally design the high-performance Li-rich Mn-based cathode materials.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03785v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

While the fully oxygenated samples are good ferromagnets, samples with larger $\delta$ values display increasingly broad magnetic transitions. The saturation magnetization at 5 K falls rapidly as $\delta$ increases. First principles electronic structure calculations provide insights into the magnetic behavior of the fully oxygenated compound, and the manner in which ferromagnetic ordering is affected by increasing oxygen non-stoichiometry.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/16/36/013	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen enhanced atomic chain formation	W. H. A. Thijssen	D. Marjenburgh, R. H. Bremmer, J. M. van Ruitenbeek	2005-09-14 18:14:25	We report experimental evidence for atomic chain formation during stretching of atomic-sized contacts for gold and silver, that is strongly enhanced due to oxygen incorporation. While gold has been known for its tendency to form atomic chains, for silver this is only observed in the presence of oxygen. With oxygen the silver chains are as long as those for gold, but the conductance drops with chain length to about 0.1 conductance quantum. A relation is suggested with previous work on surface reconstructions for silver (110) surfaces after chemisorption of oxygen.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.026806	cs	arxiv					0.0

Newman	2008-09-12 22:21:23	Oxygen was systematically incorporated in MBE grown MgB2 films using in-situ post-growth anneals in an oxygen environment. Connectivity analysis in combination with measurements of the critical temperature and resistivity indicate that oxygen is distributed both within and between the grains. High values of critical current densities in field (~4x10^5 A/cm^2 at 8 T and 4.2 K), extrabolated critical fields (>45 T) and slopes of critical field versus temperature (1.4 T/K) are observed. Our results suggest that low growth temperatures (300oC) and oxygen doping (>0.65%) can produce MgB2 with high Jc values in field and Hc2 for high-field magnet applications.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3049618	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Photogenerated singlet oxygen damages cells in optical traps	S. D. Zakharov N. C. Thanh	Aucun	2009-11-24 15:33:56	The origin of photodamage of single cells confined in laser tweezers is determined by comparison of action spectra with these recorded for a photoinduced response of cell populations. Triplet-singlet transitions in dissolved oxygen provide a common cause of both phenomena. Such transitions are forbidden in isolated O2 molecules, but occur in solutions due to the formation of temporary oxygen-solvent complexes. In dependence on the photon energy oxygen molecules may be excited alone or in combination with roto-vibrational excitations in H2O. The photodamage is a consequence of a toxic action produced by the singlet oxygen 1O2 (1.DELTA.gO2.).	http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4651v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Direct diffusion through interpenetrating networks: Oxygen in titanium	Henry H. Wu	Dallas R. Trinkle	2011-06-18 03:37:18	How impurity atoms move through a crystal is a fundamental and recurrent question in materials. The previous understanding of oxygen diffusion in titanium relied on interstitial lattice sites that were recently found to be unstable, making the diffusion pathways for oxygen unknown. Using first-principles quantum-mechanical methods, we find three oxygen interstitial sites in titanium, and quantify the multiple interpenetrating networks for oxygen diffusion. Surprisingly, no single transition dominates, but all contribute to diffusion.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.045504	cs	arxiv					0.0

Above a threshold value of oxygen vacancies, p-type conductivity sets in with up to 6 times 10^{21} charge carriers per cm3. At the same time, the band-gap is reduced continuously by more than 1 eV.

It has recently been reported that oxygen vacancies can alter the material properties, reducing its figure of merit. However, experimental data concerning the oxygen stoichiometry are contradictory. We therefore studied the formation of oxygen vacancies in Na_xCoO_2 with first principles calculations, focusing on x = 0.75. We show that a very low oxygen vacancy concentration is expected at the temperatures and partial pressures relevant for applications.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/24/47/475505	cs	arxiv					0.0

The mechanism of the reaction of the aluminium surface with single oxygen molecules is analysed. After adsorption at the surface the oxygen molecules dissociate at a femtosecond timescale and the atoms are chemisorbed at the surface at a distance of several angstrom. When the aluminium surface is exposed to higher oxygen pressure, a surface layer essentially consisting of threefold coordinated oxygen atoms starts to form.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4969v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Theoretical investigation on armchair graphene nanoribbons with
  oxygen-terminated edges"	Hongyu Ge	Guo Wang, Yi Liao	2014-11-06 08:29:35	Armchair graphene nanoribbons with different proportions of edge oxygen atoms are investigated by using crystal orbital method based on density functional theory. All the nanoribbons are energetically favorable, although buckled edges are present. Isolated edge oxygen atoms cause semiconductor-metal transition via introducing edge states, while adjacent edge oxygen atoms not. For the graphene nanoribbons with all oxygen atoms on the edges, both band gap and carrier mobility alternate with respect to the ribbon width. The carrier mobilities are as 18%-65% large as those of the graphene nanoribbons with hydrogen-terminated edges. These values are as large as 103 cm2V-1s-1, which are still quite high for electronic devices. Crystal orbital analysis gives pictorial explanations to the phenomenon.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1526v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Spin-polarized calculations show that ferromagnetism on Ni sites is reduced near the stripes and enhanced far from the stripes. Totally the magnetic moment becomes reduced because of oxygen interstitials. It is suggested that the oxygen interstitial concentration in oxygen rich domains in nickelates suppress magnetism and give multiband metallic domains.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10948-015-3322-0	cs	arxiv					0.0

Their effect on the electronic structure and optical spectra of the nanowires have been investigated using the exact exchange hybrid density functional theory calculations. A surface oxygen vacancy gives rise to appearance of a band gap state at almost 0.7 eV above the valence band of the both types of the nanowires while an oxygen adatom show bulk-like electronic properties.

Highly dense polycrystalline ceramics are prepared as micron-size grains with a minimized grain boundary extent. Electrochemical ionic migration reveals that doping controls the configuration of oxygen vacancies in the samples. Unexpectedly, we observe that electromechanical activity depends on oxygen vacancy configuration rather than on its nominal concentration. The primary creep at room temperature indicates a declining viscoelastic trend with increasing oxygen defects.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06591v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

The main reactions for generation and annihilation of oxygen and fluorine are coupled in the reaction equations while nitrogen is produced as a decay product. We find that the governing set of equations for F18(p, alpha)O15 process in the phase diagram exhibit a predominance of the direct reaction rather than the reverse reaction consuming O15. The time-scale determined by the exact solution of this system yields relatively short time-scale conversion of fluorine into oxygen indicating an energy generation of 2.8MeV per reaction. The temperature dependence shows that the effective reaction occurs at temperature about 0.04GK or above.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14131v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

The resulting expression demonstrates dramatic lowering of the layer impedance under increase in the amplitude of the oxygen concentration perturbation. In--phase oscillations of the overpotential and oxygen concentration lead to formation of a fully transparent to oxygen sub--layer. This sub--layer works as an ideal non polarizable electrode, which strongly reduces the system impedance.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08945v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Nebular Abundances of Nearby Southern Dwarf Galaxies	Henry Lee	Eva K. Grebel, Paul Hodge	2003-01-24 10:30:49	The results of optical spectroscopy of H II regions in a sample of southern dwarf irregulars consisting of five dwarf galaxies in the Centaurus A group, four dwarfs in the Sculptor group, and eight additional dwarf galaxies are presented. Oxygen abundances are derived using the direct method where [O III]4363 is detected; otherwise, abundances are derived with the bright-line method using the McGaugh and the Pilyugin calibrations. ESO358-G060 has the lowest oxygen abundance (12+log(O/H) = 7.32), which is comparable to the value for the second most metal-poor galaxy known (SBS0335-052). In all, new oxygen abundances are reported for nine dwarf galaxies; updated values are presented for the remaining galaxies. Derived oxygen abundances are in the range from 3% to 26% of the solar value. Oxygen abundances for dwarfs in the southern sample are consistent with the metallicity-luminosity relationship defined by a control sample of dwarf irregulars with [O III]4363 abundances and well-measured distances. However, NGC5264 appears to have an (upper branch) oxygen abundance approximately two to three times higher than other dwarfs at similar luminosities. Nitrogen-to-oxygen and neon-to-oxygen abundance ratios are also reported; in particular, IC1613 and IC5152 show elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios for their oxygen abundances.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20030101	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Direct MD simulation of liquid-solid phase equilibria for two-component
  plasmas"	A. S. Schneider	J. Hughto, C. J. Horowitz, D. K. Berry	2011-08-15 21:32:18	We determine the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase MD simulations. We identified liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite size effects, we perform 27648 and 55296 ion simulations. To help monitor non-equilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants $D_i$. For the carbon-oxygen system we find that $D_O$ for oxygen ions in the solid is much smaller than $D_C$ for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This suggests that errors from finite size and non-equilibrium effects are small and that the carbon-oxygen phase diagram is now accurately known. The oxygen-selenium system is a simple two-component model for more complex rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash compositions for an accreting neutron star. Diffusion of oxygen, in a predominately selenium crystal, is remarkably fast, comparable to diffusion in the liquid phase. We find a somewhat lower melting temperature for the oxygen-selenium system than that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This is probably because of electron screening effects.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.85.066405	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The oxygen partial pressure in solid oxide electrolysis cells with two
  layer electrolytes"	Qian Zhang	Qinyuan Liu, Beom-Kyeong Park, Scott Barnett, Peter Voorhees	2020-06-03 20:49:54	A number of degradation mechanisms have been observed during the long-term operation of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC). Using an electrolyte charge carrier transport model, we quantify the oxygen potentials across the electrolyte and thereby provide insights into these degradation mechanisms. Our model describes the transport of charge carriers in the electrolyte when the oxygen partial pressure is extremely low by accounting for the spatial variation of the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the electrolyte. Moreover, we identify four quantities that characterize the distribution of oxygen partial pressure in the electrolyte, which are directly related to the degradation mechanisms in the electrolyte as well: the two oxygen partial pressures at the interfaces of the electrodes and the electrolyte, the oxygen partial pressure at the interface of YSZ/GDC, and the position of the abrupt change in oxygen potential near the p-n junction that develops in YSZ when one side of the cell is exposed to fuel (low oxygen potential, n-type conduction) and the other side is exposed to oxidant (high oxygen potential, p-type conduction). We give analytical estimates for all of these quantities. These analytical expressions provide guidance on the parameters that need to be controlled to suppress the degradation observed in the electrolyte. In addition, the effects of operating conditions, particularly current density and operating temperature, on degradation are discussed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02523v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Analytical theory of oxygen transfer in the human placenta	A. S. Serov	C. Salafia, M. Filoche, D. S. Grebenkov	2014-06-27 18:10:32	We propose an analytical approach to solving the diffusion-convection equations governing oxygen transport in the human placenta. We show that only two geometrical characteristics of a placental cross-section, villi density and the effective villi radius, are needed to predict fetal oxygen uptake. We also identify two combinations of physiological parameters that determine oxygen uptake in a given placenta: (i) the maximal oxygen inflow of a placentone if there were no tissue blocking the flow, and (ii) the ratio of transit time of maternal blood through the intervillous space to oxygen extraction time. We derive analytical formulas for fast and simple calculation of oxygen uptake and provide two diagrams of efficiency of oxygen transport in an arbitrary placental cross-section. We finally show that artificial perfusion experiments with no-hemoglobin blood tend to give a two-orders-of-magnitude underestimation of the in vivo oxygen uptake and that the optimal geometry for such setup alters significantly. The theory allows one to adjust the results of artificial placenta perfusion experiments to account for oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation. Combined with image analysis techniques, the presented model can give an easy-to-use tool for prediction of the human placenta efficiency.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.12.016	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Atomic-scale insights into electro-steric substitutional chemistry of
  cerium oxide"	Haiwu Zhang	Ivano E. Castelli, Simone Santucci, Simone Sanna, Nini Pryds, Vincenzo Esposito	2021-02-10 19:16:05	Cerium oxide (ceria, CeO2) is one of the most promising mixed ionic and electronic conducting materials. Previous atomistic analysis has covered widely the effects of substitution on oxygen vacancy migration. However, an in-depth analysis of the role of cation substitution beyond trivalent cations has rarely been explored. Here, we investigate soluble monovalent, divalent, trivalent and tetravalent cation substituents. By combining classical simulations and quantum mechanical calculations, we provide an insight into defect association energies between substituent cations and oxygen vacancies as well as their effects on the diffusion mechanisms. Our simulations indicate that oxygen ionic diffusivity of subvalent cation-substituted systems follows the order Gd>Ca>Na. With the same charge, a larger size mismatch with Ce cation yields a lower oxygen ionic diffusivity, i.e., Na>K, Ca>Ni, Gd>Al. Based on these trends, we identify species that could tune the oxygen ionic diffusivity: we estimate that the optimum oxygen vacancy concentration for achieving fast oxygen ionic transport is 2.5% for GdxCe1-xO2-x/2, CaxCe1-xO2-x and NaxCe1-xO2-3x/2 at 800 K. Remarkably, such a concentration is not constant and shifts gradually to higher values as the temperature is increased. We find that co-substitutions can enhance the impact of the single substitutions beyond that expected by their simple addition. Furthermore, we identify preferential oxygen ion migration pathways, which illustrate the electro-steric effects of substituent cations in determining the energy barrier of oxygen ion migration. Such fundamental insights into the factors that govern the oxygen diffusion coefficient and migration energy would enable design criteria to be defined for tuning the ionic properties of the material, e.g., by co-doping.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D0CP03298K	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Reinforcement Learning Assisted Oxygen Therapy for COVID-19 Patients
  Under Intensive Care"	Hua Zheng	Jiahao Zhu, Wei Xie, Judy Zhong	2021-05-19 04:49:48	Patients with severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) typically require supplemental oxygen as an essential treatment. We developed a machine learning algorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care, which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice. Basically, we modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient characteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen control policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57% (95% CI: 2.08- 3.06) reduction (P<0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care to 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to patients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce resources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08923v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen abundances in G- and F-type stars from HARPS	S. Bertran de Lis	E. Delgado Mena, V. Zh. Adibekyan, N. C. Santos, S. G. Sousa	2015-01-23 14:09:55	We present a detailed and uniform study of oxygen abundance from two different oxygen lines at 6158$\AA$ and 6300$\AA$ in a large sample of solar-type stars. The results are used to check the behaviour of these spectral lines as oxygen abundance indicators and to study the evolution of oxygen in thick and thin disk populations of the Galaxy. Equivalent width measurements were carried out for the [OI]~6158$\AA$ and OI~6300$\AA$ lines. LTE abundances were obtained from these two lines in 610 and 535 stars, respectively. We were able to measure oxygen abundance from both indicators in 447 stars, enabling us, for the first time, to compare them in a uniform way. Careful error analysis has been performed. We found that oxygen abundances derived from the 6158$\AA$ and 6300$\AA$ lines agree to within 0.1dex in 58\% of the stars in our sample, and this result improves for higher signal-to-noise values. We confirm an oxygen enhancement in stars of the thick disk, as has also been seen for other $\alpha$-elements. The new oxygen abundances confirm previous findings for a progressive linear rise in the oxygen-to-iron ratio with a slope equal to 0.78 from solar metallicity to [Fe/H]$\sim$-1. However, the slope we measured is steeper than the one found in previous studies based on the oxygen triplet. Below [Fe/H]=$-$0.6 our stars show [O/Fe] ratios as high as $\sim$0.8, which can be interpreted as evidence for oxygen overproduction in the Galactic thick disk. These high oxygen abundances do not pose a problem to chemodynamical models since there is a range of parameters that can accommodate our results.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201424633	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen False Positives on Habitable Zone Planets Around Sun-Like Stars	Joshua Krissansen-Totton	Jonathan J. Fortney, Francis Nimmo, Nicholas Wogan	2021-04-13 19:11:52	Oxygen is a promising exoplanet biosignature due to the evolutionary advantage conferred by harnessing starlight for photosynthesis, and the apparent low likelihood of maintaining oxygen-rich atmospheres without life. Hypothetical scenarios have been proposed for non-biological oxygen accumulation on planets around late M-dwarfs, where the extended pre-main sequence may favor abiotic O$_2$ accumulation. In contrast, abiotic oxygen accumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less likely, provided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The comparative robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has motivated plans for next-generation telescopes capable of oxygen detection on planets around sun-like stars. However, the general tendency of terrestrial planets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial conditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a coupled thermal-geochemical-climate model of terrestrial planet evolution to illustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic oxygen can accumulate around sun-like stars, even when significant non-condensable gas inventories are present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to modern levels if (1) the CO$_2$:H$_2$O ratio of the initial volatile inventory is high, (2) the initial water inventory exceeds ~50 Earth oceans, or (3) the initial water inventory is very low. Fortunately, these three abiotic oxygen scenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of other atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This highlights the need for broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are equipped to constrain surface water inventories via time-resolved photometry and search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium biosignatures to assess whether oxygen is biogenic.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020AV000294	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Modeling the impact of spatial oxygen heterogeneity on radiolytic oxygen
  depletion during FLASH radiotherapy"	Edward Taylor	Richard P. Hill, Daniel Letourneau	2022-05-17 01:57:38	"It has been postulated that the delivery of radiotherapy at ultra-high dose rates (""FLASH"") reduces normal tissue toxicities by depleting them of oxygen. The fraction of normal tissue and cancer cells surviving radiotherapy depends on dose and oxygen levels in an exponential manner and even a very small fraction of tissue at low oxygen levels can determine radiotherapy response. The effect of FLASH on radiation-induced normal and tumour tissue cell killing was studied by simulating oxygen diffusion, metabolism, and radiolytic oxygen depletion over domains with simulated capillary architectures. Two architectural models were used: 1.) randomly distributed capillaries and 2.) capillaries forming a regular square lattice array. The resulting oxygen partial pressure distribution histograms were used to simulate normal and tumour tissue cell survival using the linear quadratic model of cell survival, modified to incorporate oxygen-enhancement ratio (OER) effects. Tumour cell survival was found to be increased by FLASH as compared to conventional radiotherapy, with a 0-1 order of magnitude increase for expected levels of tumour hypoxia, depending on the relative magnitudes of radiolytic oxygen depletion and tissue oxygen metabolism. Interestingly, for the random capillary model, the impact of FLASH on well-oxygenated (normal) tissues was found to be much greater, with an estimated increase in cell survival by up to 10 orders of magnitude, even though reductions in mean tissue partial pressure were modest, less than 7 mmHg for the parameter values studied. The presence of very small nearly hypoxic regions in otherwise well-perfused normal tissues with high mean oxygen levels resulted in a greater proportional sparing of normal tissue than tumour cells during FLASH irradiation, possibly explaining empirical normal tissue sparing and iso-tumour control results."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ac702c	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen abundances in the most oxygen-rich spiral galaxies	L. S. Pilyugin	T. X. Thuan, J. M. Vilchez	2006-01-06 12:00:25	Oxygen abundances in the spiral galaxies expected to be richest in oxygen are estimated. The new abundance determinations are based on the recently discovered ff-relation between auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in HII regions. We find that the maximum gas-phase oxygen abundance in the central regions of spiral galaxies is 12+log(O/H)~8.75. This value is significantly lower than the previously accepted value. The central oxygen abundance in the Milky Way is similar to that in other large spirals.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10033.x	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The surface chemistry of metal-oxygen interactions: a first-principles
  study of O:Rh(110)"	Kurt Stokbro	Stefano Baroni	1996-05-23 07:32:28	We report on a computational study of the clean and oxygen-covered Rh(110) surface, based on density-functional theory within the local-density approximation. We have used plane-wave basis sets and Vanderbilt ultra-soft pseudopotentials. For the clean surface, we present results for the equilibrium structure, surface energy, and surface stress of the unreconstructed and $(1\times 2)$ reconstructed structures. For the oxygen-covered surface we have performed a geometry optimization at $1\over 2$, 1, and 2 monolayer oxygen coverages, and we present results for the equilibrium configurations, workfunctions and oxygen chemisorption energies. At half monolayer coverage, we find that oxygen induces a $(1\times 2)$ reconstruction of the surface, while at one monolayer coverage the chemisorption energy is highest for the unreconstructed surface. Our results are rationalized by a simple tight-binding description of the interaction between the O$-2p$ orbitals and the metal valence states. The resulting bonds are stronger when established with low coordinated metal atoms, and give rise to an effective adsorbate-adsorbate interaction when two oxygen atoms are bound to the same metal orbital.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0039-6028(96)00962-4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Determination and Control of Oxygen Stoichiometry in the Cuprate
  Bi2sr2cuo6+D"	F. Jean	D. Colson, G. Collin, N. Blanchard, A. Forget	2003-01-07 11:00:33	The relatively low Tc of Bi2Sr2CuO6+D allows to study normal-state down to low temperatures and the non-substituted compound is intrinsically strongly overdoped. Hole concentration can be adjusted trough oxygen excess, but few data exist in the literature about the quantitative control of D. The synthesis, achieved in air by solid-state reaction, needs long-time annealing to obtain pure phase with stoichiometric cationic ratios. Thermogravimetric techniques were used to explore oxygen non-stoichiometry. Absolute oxygen content was determined by reduction with hydrogen, while the oxygen exchange was studied between 300 C and 670 C with different PO2. Oxygen excess varies between 0.14 and 0.18, with possibly two regimes of oxygen intercalation. These results are compared to Bi-2212.	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0301063v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Mechanism of Anesthetic Action: Oxygen Pathway Perturbation Hypothesis	Huping Hu	Maoxin Wu	2001-01-24 04:41:50	Although more than 150 years have past since the discovery of general anesthetics, how they precisely work remains a mystery. We propose a novel unitary mechanism of general anesthesia verifiable by experiments. In the proposed mechanism, general anesthetics perturb oxygen pathways in both membranes and oxygen-utilizing proteins such that the availabilities of oxygen to its sites of utilization are reduced which in turn triggers cascading cellular responses through oxygen-sensing mechanisms resulting in general anesthesia. Despite the general assumption that cell membranes are readily permeable to oxygen, exiting publications indicate that these membranes are plausible oxygen transport barriers. The present hypothesis provides a unified framework for explaining phenomena associated with general anesthesia and experimental results on the actions of general anesthetics. If verified by experiments, the proposed mechanism also has other significant medical and biological implications.	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0101083v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Effect of Oxygen Content on the Properties of the HoBaCo2O5+x Layered
  Cobaltite"	Yuri Diaz-Fernandez	Lorenzo Malavasi, Maria Cristina Mozzati	2008-07-09 14:37:17	In this work we present the result of the first experimental investigation of the role of oxygen content on the properties of the HoBaCo2O5+delta layered cobaltite. We have measured the variation of oxygen content as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure by means of thermogravimetry coupled to chemical titration analysis. On selected samples of accurately known oxygen content we have undertaken a systematic investigation of their structural, thermal and magnetic properties by means of x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and magnetometry. The overall results gained by this study confirm the central role of oxygen content on the properties of these materials suggesting that, for the Ho composition, even very slight variation of the order of delta=0.01 has a dramatic influence on the magnetic and transport properties of the samples. In addition, we have presented results showing the strategy to check the quality of samples prepared at selected oxygen contents by annealing procedures.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1459v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Order-disorder effect of A-site and oxygen-vacancy on magnetic and
  transport properties of Y1/4Sr3/4CoO3-delta"	Shun Fukushima	Tomonori Sato, Daisuke Akahoshi, Hideki Kuwahara	2009-01-13 09:52:56	We have synthesized A-site ordered (AO)- and A-site disordered (AD)-Y1/4Sr3/4CoO3-delta (YSCO) with various oxygen deficiency delta, and have made a comparative study of the structural and physical properties. We have found that A-site (Y/Sr) ordering produces the unconventional oxygen-vacancy ordered (OO) structure, and that the magnetic and transport properties of both AO- and AD-YSCO strongly depend on the oxygen-vacancy (or excess oxygen) ordering pattern. AO-YSCO with a stoichiometric delta of 0.5 has the unconventional OO structure reflecting Y/Sr ordering pattern. With decreasing delta from 0.5, the overall averaged OO structure is essentially unchanged except for an increase of occupancy ratio for the oxygen-vacant sites. At delta = 0.34, excess oxygen atoms are ordered to form a novel superstructure, which is significant for the room-temperature ferromagnetism of AO-YSCO. In AD-YSCO, on the other hand, the quite different OO structure, which is of a brownmillerite-type, is found only in the vicinity of delta = 0.5.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1143/JPSJ.78.064706	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Destabilization of the Zhang-Rice singlet at optimal doping	D. K. Sunko	Aucun	2009-04-22 13:35:44	The construction of the Zhang-Rice singlet is revisited in the light of recent understanding of high-temperature superconductors at optimal doping. A minimal local model is derived which contains the physical regime found relevant for ARPES experiments, characterized by significant direct oxygen-oxygen hopping. For the values of orbital parameters indicated by experiment, the Zhang-Rice singlet is strongly mixed with a pure oxygen singlet of the same symmetry. The destabilization of the Zhang-Rice ground state is due to the oxygen singlet having twice as large a coherence factor with respect to oxygen-oxygen hopping. An analogous quantum phase transition is identified in the t-t'-J model. The orbital-antisymmetric copper-oxygen singlet is confirmed to be irrelevant, as found originally. The usual symmetry analysis is extended to include dynamical symmetries.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1063776109100100	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Role of Oxygen at the Interface between Titanium and Carbon
  Nanotubes"	Alexandre Felten	Irene Suarez-Martinez, Xiaoxing Ke, Gustaaf Van Tendeloo, Jacques Ghijsen, Jean Jacques Pireaux, Wolfgang Drube, Carla Bittencourt, Christopher Ewels	2009-10-13 15:08:41	We study the interface between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and surface-deposited titanium using electron microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, supported by density functional calculations. Charge transfer from the Ti atoms to the nanotube and carbide formation is observed at the interface which indicates strong interaction. Nevertheless, the presence of oxygen between the Ti and the CNTs significantly weakens the Ti?CNT interaction. Ti atoms at the surface will preferentially bond to oxygenated sites. Potential sources of oxygen impurities are examined, namely oxygen from any residual atmosphere and pre-existing oxygen impurities on the nanotube surface, which we enhance through oxygen plasma surface pretreatment. Variation in literature data concerning Ohmic contacts between Ti and carbon nanotubes is explained via sample pre-treatment and differing vacuum levels, and we suggest improved treatment routes for reliable Schottky barrier-free Ti?nanotube contact formation.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cphc.200900193	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Turbulent Oxygen Flames in Type Ia Supernovae	A J Aspden	J B Bell, S E Woosley	2011-07-12 22:00:03	"In previous studies, we examined turbulence-flame interactions in carbon-burning thermonuclear flames in Type Ia supernovae. In this study, we consider turbulence-flame interactions in the trailing oxygen flames. The two aims of the paper are to examine the response of the inductive oxygen flame to intense levels of turbulence, and to explore the possibility of transition to detonation in the oxygen flame. Scaling arguments analogous to the carbon flames are presented and then compared against three-dimensional simulations for a range of Damk\""ohler numbers ($\Da_{16}$) at a fixed Karlovitz number. The simulations suggest that turbulence does not significantly affect the oxygen flame when $\Da_{16}<1$, and the flame burns inductively some distance behind the carbon flame. However, for $\Da_{16}>1$, turbulence enhances heat transfer and drives the propagation of a flame that is {\em narrower} than the corresponding inductive flame would be. Furthermore, burning under these conditions appears to occur as part of a combined carbon-oxygen turbulent flame with complex compound structure. The simulations do not appear to support the possibility of a transition to detonation in the oxygen flame, but do not preclude it either."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/144	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Imaging Oxygen Defects and their Motion at a Manganite Surface	Benjamin Bryant	Christoph Renner, Yusuke Tokunaga, Yoshinori Tokura, Gabriel Aeppli	2011-10-04 11:06:24	Manganites are technologically important materials, used widely as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: they have also been shown to exhibit electroresistance. Oxygen bulk diffusion and surface exchange processes are critical for catalytic action, and numerous studies of manganites have linked electroresistance to electrochemical oxygen migration. Direct imaging of individual oxygen defects is needed to underpin understanding of these important processes. It is not currently possible to collect the required images in the bulk, but scanning tunnelling microscopy could provide such data for surfaces. Here we show the first atomic resolution images of oxygen defects at a manganite surface. Our experiments also reveal defect dynamics, including oxygen adatom migration, vacancy-adatom recombination and adatom bistability. Beyond providing an experimental basis for testing models describing the microscopics of oxygen migration at transition metal oxide interfaces, our work resolves the long-standing puzzle of why scanning tunnelling microscopy is more challenging for layered manganites than for cuprates.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1219	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Displacement Waves of Oxygen Atoms in Bi,Pb-2223 Lattice of Composites
  Annealed in Oxygen Reduced (O2+N2) Atmosphere"	T. P. Krinitsina	S. V. Sudareva, E. I. Kuznetsova, Yu. V. Blinova	2013-06-05 08:05:03	Annealing of Bi,Pb-2223/Ag composites in (O2+N2) atmosphere at 820-780C is believed to reduce the number of the accompanying phases, to make contacts between crystallites closer and to increase the critical current. The goals of this study were to reveal the changes in the 2223 lattice at annealing in the reduced oxygen atmosphere, to elucidate the reasons of these changes and to discuss their effect on the ceramics superconductivity. After the annealing the transversely-polarized displacement waves of oxygen atoms in [010]2223 direction have been found in the 2223 phase by electron diffraction analysis. These waves could appear due to the lack of oxygen in the 2223 lattice or to the nitrogen penetration in it. As demonstrated by the X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy and nuclear microanalysis, nitrogen does not interact with the 2223 lattice, and the oxygen index decreases to 9.67, which is lower than the stoichiometric. Thus, the atomic displacement waves result from the lack of oxygen in Bi-O bilayers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1016v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Orienting oxygen vacancies for fast catalytic reaction	Hyoungjeen Jeen	Zhonghe Bi, Woo Seok Choi, Matthew F. Chisholm, Craig A. Bridges, M. Parans Paranthaman, Ho Nyung Lee	2013-10-03 14:02:59	Catalysis is indispensable to chemical processes and relevant to many aspects of modern life. Owing to the intriguing electronic structures and good ionic properties, multivalent transition metal oxides have attracted attention as key catalysts for various energy and environmental applications. Here, we demonstrate that brownmillerite strontium cobaltite (SrCoO2.5) can be a good cathode material for sold oxide fuel cells and rechargeable batteries due to the open oxygen frameworks. When the orientation of oxygen vacancy channels (OVCs) is properly controlled, one can drastically increase the surface oxygen exchange rate approximately up to two orders of magnitude. The improved oxygen reduction kinetics is attributed to a substantial decrease in the thermal activation energy. Importantly, the strong enhancement of crystallographic orientation-dependent oxygen reduction reaction required the creation of neither structural disorders nor chemical doping. Thus, our epitaxial approach can pave a novel pathway to providing precise interpretation of oxygen reduction reactions and to developing oxide-based energy materials.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.201302919	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Is silicene stable in air? -- First principles study of oxygen
  adsorption and dissociation on silicene"	G. Liu	X. L. Lei, M. S. Wu, B. Xu, C. Y. OuYang	2013-10-25 04:59:43	The oxygen adsorption and dissociation on pristine silicene surface are studied by use of first-principles in this letter. The oxygen adsorption and dissociation on pristine silicene surface are studied by use of first-principles in this letter. It is found that the pristine silicene is not stable in air because the oxygen molecule can be easily adsorbed and dissociated into two O atoms without overcoming any energy barrier on pristine silicene surface. In addition, dissociated oxygen atoms are relatively difficult to migrate on or desorbed from pristine silicene surface, leading to poor mobility of oxygen atom. As a result, silicene would be changed into Si-O compounds in air. The work will be helpful to reveal the detail of the interaction between oxygen molecules and pristine silicene surface, especially helpful to understand the stability of silicene in air.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6820v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Interaction of oxygen interstitials with lattice faults in Ti	M. Ghazisaeidi	D. R. Trinkle	2014-03-12 04:28:27	Oxygen greatly affects the mechanical properties of titanium. In addition, dislocations and twin boundaries influence the plastics deformation of hcp metals. As part of a systematic study of defects interactions in Ti, we investigate the interactions of oxygen with (10-12) twin boundary and (10-10) prism plane stacking fault. The energetics of four interstitial sites in the twin geometry are compared with the bulk octahedral site. We show that two of these sites located at the twin boundary are more attractive to oxygen than bulk while the sites away from the boundary are repulsive. Moreover, we study the interaction of oxygen with the prismatic stacking fault to approximate oxygen-dislocation interaction. We show that oxygen increases the stacking fault energy and therefore is repelled by the faulted geometry and consequently a dislocation core.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2806v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Habermeier	2014-12-01 10:42:49	The interrelation between the epitaxial strain and oxygen deficiency in La0.7Ca0.3MnO3-{\delta} thin films was studied in terms of structural and functional properties. The films with a thickness of 1000{\AA} were prepared using a PLD system equipped with a RHEED facility and a pyrometric film temperature control. The epitaxial strain and the oxygen deficiency in the samples were systematically modified using three different substrates: SrTiO3, (LaAlO3)0.3-(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 and LaSrAlO4, and four different oxygen pressures during film growth ranging from 0.27mbar to 0.1mbar. It could be demonstrated that the oxygen incorporation depends on the epitaxial strain: oxygen vacancies were induced to accommodate tensile strain whereas the compressive strain suppressed the generation of oxygen vacancies.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2014.11.055	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Reply to Mills et al.: Oceanic Anoxic Event, a mechanism for selecting
  animals with the ability to survive hypoxic conditions"	Francois Saint-Antonin	Aucun	2015-04-28 08:52:06	"It is generally considered that animal life was triggered by the rise of oxygen levels. Based on experiments evaluating the minimum range of oxygen levels at which sponges can survive, Mills and coauthors (doi:10.1073/pnas.1400547111) defend the opposite view. However, the authors do not demonstrate that ""animal life was not triggered by the oxygen rise"" is the only possible and unique conclusion from their observation. In this reply, it is suggested that a mechanism to explain the ability of sponges to survive at low oxygen biota is Ocean Anoxic Events. These lead to oxygen depletion and a series of them would selectively favor animals able to survive at low oxygen levels. Thus, the origin of the ability of marine animals to survive in low oxygen biota remains to be clarified."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07382v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Reply to Saint-Antonin: Low-oxygen-tolerant animals predate oceanic
  anoxic events"	Daniel B. Mills	Lewis M. Ward, CarriAyne Jones, Brittany Sweeten, Michael Forth, Alexander H. Treusch, Donald E. Canfield	2015-04-30 16:34:36	It is has been assumed for over half a century that the earliest animals were obligate aerobes with relatively high oxygen requirements. However, the conserved biochemistry and widespread phylogenetic distribution of anaerobic energy metabolism in animals suggests a deep ancestral possession of the genes and enzymes necessary for a facultative anaerobic lifestyle. Additionally, non-bilaterian bodyplans are not expected to require particularly high environmental oxygen levels. This is consistent with experimental evidence demonstrating the low-oxygen tolerance of the sponge Halichondria panicea. While it is conceivable that low-oxygen-adapted animals evolved only sometime during the past 541 million years, perhaps in response to oceanic anoxic events, they most reasonably date back to the first animals themselves, as the last common ancestor of animals likely emerged in a relatively low-oxygen world, possessed the genetic means for anaerobiosis, and exhibited a bodyplan conducive to aerobic growth under oxygen levels less than 4% of modern atmospheric saturation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08298v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"First principle thermodynamic study of oxygen vacancy at metal/oxide
  interface"	Guanchen Li	Eric Tea, Jianqiu Huang, Celine Hin	2016-11-10 17:30:36	The oxygen vacancy is a crucial intrinsic defect in metal-ultrathin oxide semiconductor heterostructures, and its formation at an interface is of great importance in determining the device performance and degradation. This paper presents an ab initio thermodynamic study of oxygen vacancies at metal/oxide interfaces. Electronic energies and entropies are calculated for defective interface systems, as a function of interface-vacancy distance. The study indicates that oxygen vacancies near the interface modify its bonding structure, and significantly change the thermodynamic properties of the system (i.e., electronic energy and entropy) compared to bulk-like oxygen vacancies. We illustrate that different factors, including the vacancy location dependence on the energy and entropy, the temperature dependence on the entropy, and the temperature and partial pressure dependence on the oxygen chemical potential, are all important in determining the Gibbs free energy of formation of oxygen vacancy.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03411v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Here we combine low-temperature thermal treatment of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ epitaxial thin films and confocal Raman spectroscopy to control and investigate oxygen vacancies. We demonstrate that the apical site is the most favorable position to accommodate oxygen vacancies under low-temperature annealing conditions. Additionally we show that in high-quality films of overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, oxygen vacancies strongly deform the oxygen environment around the copper ions. This observation is consistent with previous defect-chemical studies, and calls for further investigation of the defect induced properties in the overdoped regime of the hole-doped lanthanum cuprates.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.054801	cs	arxiv					0.0

  oxygen-deficient SmFeAsO1-x"	Yoshinori Muraba	Soshi Iimura, Satoru Matsuishi, Hideo Hosono	2015-11-09 10:23:10	We investigated the preferred electron dopants at the oxygen sites of 1111-type SmFeAsO by changing the atmospheres around the precursor with the composition of Sm:Fe:As:O = 1:1:1:1-x in high-pressure synthesis. Under H2O and H2 atmospheres, hydrogens derived from H2O or H2 molecules were introduced into the oxygen sites as a hydride ion, and SmFeAsO1-xHx was obtained. However, when the H2O and H2 sources were removed from the synthetic process, nearly stoichiometric SmFeAsO was obtained and the maximum amount of oxygen vacancies introduced remained x = 0.05(4). Density functional theory calculations indicated that substitution of hydrogen in the form of H- is more stable than the formation of an oxygen vacancy at the oxygen site of SmFeAsO. These results strongly imply that oxygen-deficient SmFeAsO1-x reported previously is SmFeAsO1-xHx with hydride ion incorporated unintentionally during high-pressure synthesis.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b02248	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Structure Evolution of Graphene Oxide during Thermally Driven Phase
  Transformation: Is the Oxygen Content Really Preserved?"	Pengzhan Sun	Yanlei Wang, He Liu, Kunlin Wang, Dehai Wu, Zhiping Xu, Hongwei Zhu	2014-09-26 23:13:49	A mild annealing procedure was recently proposed for the scalable enhancement of graphene oxide (GO) properties with the oxygen content preserved, which was demonstrated to be attributed to the thermally driven phase separation. In this work, the structure evolution of GO with mild annealing is closely investigated. It reveals that in addition to phase separation, the transformation of oxygen functionalities also occurs, which leads to the slight reduction of GO membranes and furthers the enhancement of GO properties. These results are further supported by the density functional theory based calculations. The results also show that the amount of chemically bonded oxygen atoms on graphene decreases gradually and we propose that the strongly physisorbed oxygen species constrained in the holes and vacancies on GO lattice might be responsible for the preserved oxygen content during the mild annealing procedure. The present experimental results and calculations indicate that both the diffusion and transformation of oxygen functional groups might play important roles in the scalable enhancement of GO properties.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111908	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen Potential Transition in Mixed Conducting Oxide Electrolyte	Yanhao Dong	I-Wei Chen	2018-07-07 18:26:22	It is generally assumed that oxygen potential in a thin oxide electrolyte follows a linear distribution between electrodes. Jacobsen and Mogensen have shown, however, that this is not the case for thin zirconia membranes in solid oxide electrochemical cells. Here we demonstrate that there is a ubiquitous oxygen potential transition rooted in the p-type/n-type transition of electronic conductivity inside mixed conducting oxides, and that the transition is extremely sensitive to electrode potential and current density. It is also remarkably sensitive to the conductivity ratio of electrons and holes, as well as their association with lattice oxygens and vacancies, which tends to increase the oxygen flow. Direct evidence of a sharp oxygen potential transition has been found in an equally sharp grain size transition in electrically loaded zirconia. More broadly speaking, the oxygen potential transition is akin to a first-order phase transition. Therefore, it will suffer interface instability, especially in high-current-density devices. These findings provide new opportunities to understand several disparate observations in the literature, from microstructural degradation and stress distribution in solid oxide fuel/electrolyzer cells, to field-assisted sintering, to conducting filaments in resistance memory, to dendrite formation in electrochemical cells.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2018.06.014	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Insights into the enhancement of oxygen mass transport properties of
  strontium doped lanthanum manganite interface-dominated thin films"	Francesco Chiabrera	Alex Morata, Merce Pacios, Albert Tarancon	2018-11-30 12:50:06	Strontium doped lanthanum manganite thin films were deposited by pulsed laser deposition on yttria stabilized zirconia single crystals for a comprehensive electrochemical characterization of the material acting as a cathode. A physically meaningful electrical model was employed to fit the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results in order to extract the main oxygen mass transport parameters as a function of the temperature and oxygen partial pressure. The oxygen diffusion and surface exchange coefficients extracted from the analysis showed several orders of magnitude of enhancement with respect to the bulk values reported in the literature and an unexpectedly low dependence with the oxygen partial pressure. Different observations were combined to propose a mechanism for the enhanced incorporation of oxygen in interface dominated thin films mainly based on the high concentration of oxygen vacancies expected in the grain boundaries.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssi.2016.08.009	cs	arxiv					0.0

Here, we report on an in-situ study of the oxygen exposure effect on spin-orbit torque in Pt/Co bilayers via controlled oxygen exposure, Co and Mg deposition, and electrical measurements in ultrahigh vacuum. We show that the oxygen exposure on Pt/Co indeed leads to an increase of spin-orbit torque, but the enhancement is not as large as those reported previously. Similar enhancement of spin-orbit torque is also observed after the deposition of an MgO capping layer. The results of ab initio calculations on the Rashba splitting of Pt/Co and Pt/Co/O suggest that the enhancement is due to enhanced Rashba-Edelstein effect by surface-adsorbed oxygen. Our findings shed some light on the varying roles of oxygen in modifying the spin torque efficiency reported previously.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09810v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Hemoglobin Non-equilibrium Oxygen Dissociation Curve	Rosella Scrima	Sabino Fugetto, Nazzareno Capitanio, Domenico L. Gatti	2019-12-31 22:03:51	Abnormal hemoglobins can have major consequences for tissue delivery of oxygen. Correct diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies with altered oxygen affinity requires a determination of hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), which relates the hemoglobin oxygen saturation to the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. Determination of the ODC of human hemoglobin is typically carried out under conditions in which hemoglobin is in equilibrium with O2 at each partial pressure. However, in the human body due to the fast transit of RBCs through tissues hemoglobin oxygen exchanges occur under non-equilibrium conditions. We describe the determination of non-equilibrium ODC, and show that under these conditions Hb cooperativity has two apparent components in the Adair, Perutz, and MWC models of Hb. The first component, which we call sequential cooperativity, accounts for ~70% of Hb cooperativity, and emerges from the constraint of sequential binding that is shared by the three models. The second component, which we call conformational cooperativity, accounts for ~30% of Hb cooperativity, and is due either to a conformational equilibrium between low affinity and high affinity tetramers (as in the MWC model), or to a conformational change from low to high affinity once two of the tetramer sites are occupied (Perutz model).	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00091v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Absence of Luther-Emery Superconducting Phase in the Three-Band Model
  for Cuprate Ladders"	Jeong-Pil Song	Sumit Mazumdar, R. Torsten Clay	2020-10-20 20:38:27	Correlated-electron theories of superconductivity in layered cuprates often start from the premise of a gapped spin-liquid phase proximate to the superconducting state. This assumption is justified based on analytical and numerical demonstrations of a superconducting Luther-Emery phase in the doped 2-leg one-band Hubbard ladder, and the perceived analogy between coupled ladders and the two dimensional CuO2 layer. We demonstrate from accurate density matrix renormalization group studies the absence of the superconducting Luther-Emery phase in the doped 2-leg three-band ladder consisting of both copper and oxygen, even as the spin gap is large in the undoped three-band ladder. For realistic oxygen-oxygen hopping and Hubbard repulsion on the oxygen atoms, density-density rather than pairing correlations are dominant at long range. This result is equally valid whether or not the oxygens outside the ladder proper, over and above the rung and leg oxygens, are included in the computation. These results demonstrate the critical importance of oxygen orbitals, and raise disturbing questions about the applicability of many of the existing correlated-electron theories of superconductivity.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.104504	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Reversible modulation of metal-insulator transition in VO2 via
  chemically-induced oxygen migration"	Kun Han	Hanyu Wang, Liang Wu, Yu Cao, Dong-Chen Qi, Changjian Li, Zhen Huang, Xiao Li, X. Renshaw Wang	2021-09-11 12:24:01	Metal-insulator transitions (MIT),an intriguing correlated phenomenon induced by the subtle competition of the electrons' repulsive Coulomb interaction and kinetic energy, is of great potential use for electronic applications due to the dramatic change in resistivity. Here, we demonstrate a reversible control of MIT in VO2 films via oxygen stoichiometry engineering. By facilely depositing and dissolving a water-soluble yet oxygen-active Sr3Al2O6 capping layer atop the VO2 at room temperature, oxygen ions can reversibly migrate between VO2 and Sr3Al2O6, resulting in a gradual suppression and a complete recovery of MIT in VO2. The migration of the oxygen ions is evidenced in a combination of transport measurement, structural characterization and first-principles calculations. This approach of chemically-induced oxygen migration using a water-dissolvable adjacent layer could be useful for advanced electronic and iontronic devices and studying oxygen stoichiometry effects on the MIT.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0058989	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Chemical Power for Swarms of Microscopic Robots in Blood Vessels	Tad Hogg	Aucun	2023-01-11 19:39:27	Microscopic robots in the bloodstream could obtain power from fuel cells using glucose and oxygen. Previous studies of small numbers of such robots operating near each other showed how robots compete with their neighbors for oxygen. However, proposed applications involve billions of such robots operating throughout the body. With such large numbers, the robots can have systemic effects on oxygen concentration. This paper evaluates these effects and their consequences for robot power generation, oxygen available to tissue and heating as such robots move with the blood. When robots consume oxygen as fast as it diffuses to their surfaces, available power decreases significantly as robots move from the lungs, through arteries to capillaries and veins. Tens of billions of robots can obtain hundreds of picowatts throughout the circuit, while a trillion robots significantly deplete oxygen in the veins. Robots can mitigate this depletion by limiting their oxygen consumption, either overall or in specific locations or situations.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11286v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Spontaneous Oxygen Vacancy Ionization Enhances Water Oxidation on
  BiVO$_4$"	Nicklas Österbacka	Hassan Ouhbi, Francesco Ambrosio, Julia Wiktor	2023-06-16 15:47:31	The influence of surface oxygen vacancies on the oxygen evolution reaction on bismuth vanadate is studied using hybrid density functional theory. Our findings reveal the thermodynamic instability of the neutral unionized defect (${\rm V}_{\rm O}^0$), leading to spontaneous ionization into ${\rm V}_{\rm O}^{2+}$. By investigating the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on both stoichiometric and oxygen-deficient surfaces, we find that surface oxygen vacancies reduce the reaction's thermodynamic overpotential, but only when the defects are ionized. Moreover, the reaction pathway involves the formation of surface-bound peroxide and superoxide ions as intermediates. Our work provides insight into the nature of surface oxygen vacancies and shines new light on how they may enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of semiconductors.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09923v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The Oxygen Bottleneck for Technospheres	Amedeo Balbi	Adam Frank	2023-08-02 14:06:04	As oxygen is essential for respiration and metabolism for multicellular organisms on Earth, its presence may be crucial for the development of a complex biosphere on other planets. And because life itself, through photosynthesis, contributed to creating our oxygen-rich atmosphere, oxygen has long been considered as a possible biosignature. Here we consider the relationship between atmospheric oxygen and the development of technology. We argue that only planets with substantial oxygen partial pressure ($p_{\rm O_2}$) will be capable of developing advanced technospheres and hence technosignatures that we can detect. But open-air combustion (needed, for example, for metallurgy), is possible only in Earth-like atmospheres when $p_{\rm O_2}\ge 18\%$. This limit is higher than the one needed to sustain a complex biosphere and multicellular organisms. We further review other possible planetary atmospheric compositions and conclude that oxygen is the most likely candidate for the evolution of technological species. Thus, the presence of $p_{\rm O_2}\ge 18\%$ in exoplanet atmospheres may represent a contextual prior required for the planning and interpretation of technosignature searches.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41550-023-02112-8	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Extended defects-enhanced oxygen diffusion in ThO2	Miaomiao Jin	Jilang Miao, Beihan Chen, Marat Khafizov, Yongfeng Zhang, David H. Hurley	2023-09-18 17:14:41	Oxygen self-diffusion is key to understanding stoichiometry and defect structures in oxide nuclear fuels. Experimentally, low activation-barrier oxygen migration was found in ThO$_2$, a candidate nuclear fuel, possibly due to short-circuit diffusion mechanisms. Here, we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations to show that various types of extended defects can enhance oxygen self-diffusion with a much-reduced activation barrier in ThO$_2$. In this work, we consider extended defects including 1D (dislocation), 2D (grain boundary), and 3D (void) defects. Due to the distinct characteristics of each type of extended defect, the modulation of oxygen diffusion varies. These results provide a quantitative description of oxygen transport, which is significantly enhanced within a close distance (nanometer scale) from the extended defects. Among all these defects, grain boundary, particularly the $\Sigma 3$ twin boundary with a low formation energy, exhibits the strongest effect on increasing oxygen transport.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09952v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen abundances in unevolved metal-poor stars from near-UV OH lines	G. Israelian	R. Garcia Lopez, R. Rebolo	1998-06-17 14:43:55	We have performed a detailed oxygen abundance analysis of 23 metal-poor (-3.0<[Fe/H]<-0.3) unevolved halo stars and one giant through the OH bands in the near UV, using high-resolution echelle spectra. Oxygen is found to be overabundant with respect to iron in these stars, with the [O/Fe] ratio increasing from 0.6 to 1 between [Fe/H]=-1.5 and -3.0. The behavior of the oxygen overabundance with respect to [Fe/H] is similar to that seen in previous works based on OI IR triplet data (Abia and Rebolo 1989; Tomkin et al. 1992; Cavallo, Pilachowski, and Rebolo 1997). Contrary to the previously accepted picture, our oxygen abundances, derived from low-excitation OH lines, agree well with those derived from high-excitation lines of the triplet. For nine stars in common with Tomkin et al. we obtain a mean difference of 0.00+/-0.11 dex with respect to the abundances determined from the triplet using the same stellar parameters and model photospheres. For four stars in our sample we have found measurements of the [OI] 6300 A line in the literature, from which we derive oxygen abundances consistent (average difference 0.09 dex) with those based on OH lines, showing that the long standing controversy between oxygen abundances from forbidden and permitted lines in metal-poor unevolved stars can be resolved. Our new oxygen abundances show a smooth extension of the Edvardsson et al.'s (1993) [O/Fe] versus metallicity curve to much lower abundances, with a slope -0.31+/- 0.11 (taking into account the error bars in both oxygen abundances and metallicities) in the range -3<[Fe/H]<-1.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/306351	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Abundance determinations in HII regions: model fitting versus Te-method	L. S. Pilyugin	Aucun	2002-11-14 09:20:17	"The discrepancy between the oxygen abundances in high-metallicity HII regions determined through the Te-method (and/or through the corresponding ""strong lines - oxygen abundance"" calibration) and that determined through the model fitting (and/or through the corresponding ""strong lines - oxygen abundance"" calibration) is discussed. It is suggested to use the interstellar oxygen abundance in the solar vicinity, derived with very high precision from the high-resolution observations of the weak interstellar absorption lines towards the stars, as a ""Rosetta stone"" to verify the validity of the oxygen abundances derived in HII regions with the Te-method at high abundances. The agreement between the value of the oxygen abundance at the solar galactocentric distance traced by the abundances derived in HII regions through the Te-method and that derived from the interstellar absorption lines towards the stars is strong evidence in favor of that i) the two-zone model for Te seems to be a realistic interpretation of the temperature structure within HII regions, and ii) the classic Te-method provides accurate oxygen abundances in HII regions. It has been concluded that the ""strong lines - oxygen abundance"" calibrations must be based on the HII regions with the oxygen abundances derived with the Te-method but not on the existing grids of the models for HII regions."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20021669	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Investigating The Possible Anomaly Between Nebular and Stellar Oxygen
  Abundances in the Dwarf Irregular Galaxy WLM"	Henry Lee	Evan D. Skillman, Kim A. Venn	2004-10-26 20:00:13	We obtained new optical spectra of 13 H II regions in WLM with EFOSC2; oxygen abundances are derived for nine H II regions. The temperature-sensitive [O III] 4363 emission line was measured in two bright H II regions HM7 and HM9. The direct oxygen abundances for HM7 and HM9 are 12+log(O/H) = 7.72 +/- 0.04 and 7.91 +/- 0.04, respectively. We adopt a mean oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 7.83 +/- 0.06. This corresponds to [O/H] = -0.83 dex, or 15% of the solar value. In H II regions where [O III] 4363 was not measured, oxygen abundances derived with bright-line methods are in general agreement with direct values of the oxygen abundance to an accuracy of about 0.2 dex. In general, the present measurements show that the H II region oxygen abundances agree with previous values in the literature. The nebular oxygen abundances are marginally consistent with the mean stellar magnesium abundance ([Mg/H] = -0.62). However, there is still a 0.62 dex discrepancy in oxygen abundance between the nebular result and the A-type supergiant star WLM15 ([O/H] = -0.21). Non-zero reddening values derived from Balmer line ratios were found in H II regions near a second H I peak. There may be a connection between the location of the second H I peak, regions of higher extinction, and the position of WLM15 on the eastern side of the galaxy.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/427019	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Redox functionality mediated by adsorbed oxygen on a Pd-oxide film over
  a Pd(100) thin structure: A first-principles study"	K. Kusakabe	K. Harada, Y. Ikuno, H. Nagara	2009-09-30 00:51:04	Stable oxygen sites on a PdO film over a Pd(100) thin structures with a (sqrt{5} times sqrt{5}) R27^circ surface-unit cell are determined using the first-principles electronic structure calculations with the generalized gradient approximation. The adsorbed monatomic oxygen goes to a site bridging two 2-fold-coordinated Pd atoms or to a site bridging a 2-fold-coordinated Pd atom and a 4-fold-coordinated Pd atom. Estimated reaction energies of CO oxidation by reduction of the oxidized PdO film and N_2O reduction mediated by oxidation of the PdO film are exothermic. Motion of the adsorbed oxygen atom between the two stable sites is evaluated using the nudged elastic band method, where an energy barrier for a translational motion of the adsorbed oxygen may become sim 0.45 eV, which is low enough to allow fluxionality of the surface oxygen at high temperatures. The oxygen fluxionality is allowed by existence of 2-fold-coordinated Pd atoms on the PdO film, whose local structure has similarity to that of Pd catalysts for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling. Although NO_x (including NO_2 and NO) reduction is not always catalyzed only by the PdO film, we conclude that there may happen continual redox reactions mediated by oxygen-adsorbed PdO films over a Pd surface structure, when the influx of NO_x and CO continues, and when the reaction cycle is kept on a well-designed oxygen surface.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/21/48/485003	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Interactions between Oxygen Interstitial and <a>-Type Screw Dislocations
  in alpha-Titanium"	Liang Qi	Tomohito Tsuru, Mark Asta, Daryl Chrzan	2015-02-18 06:03:14	We employ density-functional-theory calculations to analyze the interactions between oxygen interstitial atoms and <a>-type screw dislocations (<a> = a<11-20>/3 ) in alpha-titanium, based on investigations of generalized stacking fault (GSF) energies, dislocation core structures and the strain field of an oxygen interstitial. Compared with the substitutional atoms such as Al, there is a large repulsive interaction between oxygen interstitials at the octahedral site and an <a>-type screw dislocation core, since the volume for the interstitial atom between Ti lattice sites is largely reduced in the core. Differential displacement maps and distributions of interstitial volume surrounding the dislocation core show that the interaction with an oxygen interstitial is very short ranged (~ 5 Angstrom) and directional, mainly located on the prismatic plane where the majority of lattice displacements in the <a> screw dislocation core occurs. At long distances the interactions mediated by the strain from the interstitial oxygen and the dislocation vanish. We show that the large repulsive interaction at short range can push an oxygen atom from its original interstitial site to a new interstitial site on the basal plane in the dislocation core. The strong repulsive interaction and the mechanical shuffle of oxygen interstitials can be expected to have a large impact on dislocation dynamics, and can be used to explain the strong strengthening effects of oxygen impurities in alpha-titanium observed experimentally.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05129v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Exchange interactions in transition metal oxides: The role of oxygen
  spin polarization"	R. Logemann	A. N. Rudenko, M. I. Katsnelson, A. Kirilyuk	2016-11-22 13:19:19	Magnetism of transition metal (TM) oxides is usually described in terms of the Heisenberg model, with orientation-independent interactions between the spins. However, the applicability of such a model is not fully justified for TM oxides because spin polarization of oxygen is usually ignored. In the conventional model based on the Anderson principle, oxygen effects are considered as a property of the TM ion and only TM interactions are relevant. Here, we perform a systematic comparison between two approaches for spin polarization on oxygen in typical TM oxides. To this end, we calculate the exchange interactions in NiO, MnO, and hematite (Fe2O3) for different magnetic configurations using the magnetic force theorem. We consider the full spin Hamiltonian including oxygen sites, and also derive an effective model where the spin polarization on oxygen renormalizes the exchange interactions between TM sites. Surprisingly, the exchange interactions in NiO depend on the magnetic state if spin polarization on oxygen is neglected, resulting in non-Heisenberg behavior. In contrast, the inclusion of spin polarization in NiO makes the Heisenberg model more applicable. Just the opposite, MnO behaves as a Heisenberg magnet when oxygen spin polarization is neglected, but shows strong non-Heisenberg effects when spin polarization on oxygen is included. In hematite, both models result in non-Heisenberg behavior. General applicability of the magnetic force theorem as well as the Heisenberg model to TM oxides is discussed.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/aa7b00	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Constraining the final fates of massive stars by oxygen and iron
  enrichment history in the Galaxy"	Akihiro Suzuki	Keiichi Maeda	2017-12-06 03:01:34	Recent observational studies of core-collapse supernovae suggest only stars with zero-age main sequence masses smaller than $16$-$18\ M_\odot$ explode when they are red supergiants, producing type IIP supernovae. This may imply that more massive stars produce other types of supernovae or they simply collapse to black holes without giving rise to bright supernovae. This failed supernova hypothesis can lead to significantly inefficient oxygen production because oxygen abundantly produced in inner layers of massive stars with zero-age main sequence masses around $20$-$30\ M_\odot$ might not be ejected into the surrounding interstellar space. We first assume an unspecified population of oxygen injection events related to massive stars and obtain a model-independent constraint on how much oxygen should be released in a single event and how frequently such events should happen. We further carry out one-box galactic chemical enrichment calculations with different mass ranges of massive stars exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Our results suggest that the model assuming that all massive stars with $9$-$100\ M_\odot$ explode as core-collapse supernovae is still most appropriate in explaining the solar abundances of oxygen and iron and their enrichment history in the Galaxy. The oxygen mass in the Galaxy is not explained when assuming that only massive stars with zero-age main sequence masses in the range of 9-17 $M_\odot$, contribute to the galactic oxygen enrichment. This finding implies that a good fraction of stars more massive than $17M_\odot$ should eject their oxygen layers in either supernova explosions or some other mass loss processes.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaa024	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Thermodynamic Stability of Molybdenum Oxycarbides Formed from
  Orthorhombic Mo2C in Oxygen-rich Environments"	S. R. J. Likith	C. A. Farberow, S. Manna, A. Abdulslam, V. Stevanović, D. A. Ruddy, J. A. Schaidle, D. J. Robichaud, C. V. Ciobanu	2018-03-30 17:34:22	Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles and thin films are particularly suitable catalysts for catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) as they are effective for deoxygenation and can catalyze certain reactions that typically occur on noble metals. Oxygen deposited during deoxygenation reactions may alter the carbide structure leading to the formation of oxycarbides, which can determine changes in catalytic activity or selectivity. Despite emerging spectroscopic evidence of bulk oxycarbides, so far there have been no reports of their precise atomic structure or their relative stability with respect to orthorhombic Mo2C. This knowledge is essential for assessing the catalytic properties of molybdenum (oxy)carbides for CFP. In this article, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to (a) describe the thermodynamic stability of surface and subsurface configurations of oxygen and carbon atoms for a commonly studied Mo-terminated surface of orthorhombic Mo2C, and (b) determine atomic structures for oxycarbides with a Mo:C ratio of 2:1. The surface calculations suggest that oxygen atoms are not stable under the top Mo layer of the Mo2C(100) surface. Coupling DFT calculations with a polymorph sampling method, we determine (Mo2C)xOy oxycarbide structures for a wide range of oxygen compositions. Oxycarbides with lower oxygen content (y/x <=2) adopt layered structures reminiscent of the parent carbide phase, with flat Mo layers separated by layers of oxygen and carbon; for higher oxygen content, our results suggest the formation of amorphous phases, as the atomic layers lose their planarity with increasing oxygen content.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11110	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Oxygen Loss from Simulated Galaxies and the Metal Flow Main Sequence:
  Predicting the Dependence on Mass and Environment"	Philip Taylor	Chiaki Kobayashi, Lisa J. Kewley	2020-06-27 04:01:11	We predict the mass fraction of oxygen lost from galaxies in a cosmological simulation as a function of stellar mass and environment at the present day. The distribution with stellar mass is bimodal, separating star-forming and quenched galaxies. The metallicity of gas and stars is self-consistently calculated using a chemical evolution model that includes supernovae type II and Ia, hypernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. The mass of oxygen lost from each galaxy is calculated by comparing the existing oxygen in gas and stars in the galaxy to the oxygen that should have been produced by the present-day population of stars. More massive galaxies are able to retain a greater fraction of their metals ($\sim 100$ per cent) than low-mass galaxies ($\sim 40 - 70$ per cent). As in the star formation main sequence, star-forming galaxies follow a tight relationship also in terms of oxygen mass lost -- a metal flow main sequence, ZFMS -- whereas massive quenched galaxies tend to have lost a greater fraction of oxygen (up to 20 per cent), due to AGN-driven winds. The amount of oxygen lost by satellite galaxies depends on the details of their interaction history, and those in richer groups tend to have lost a greater fraction of their oxygen. Observational estimates of metal retention in galaxies will provide a strong constraint on models of galaxy evolution.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa1904	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Buildup of Abiotic Oxygen and Ozone in Moist Atmospheres of Temperate
  Terrestrial Exoplanets and its Impact on the Spectral Fingerprint in Transit
  Observations"	Armin Kleinböhl	Karen Willacy, A. James Friedson, Pin Chen, Mark R. Swain	2018-05-25 19:05:56	We investigate the abiotic production of oxygen and its photochemical byproduct ozone through water vapor photolysis in moist atmospheres of temperate terrestrial exoplanets. The amount of water vapor available for photolysis in the middle atmosphere of a planet can be limited by an atmospheric cold-trap, the formation of which largely depends on the amount of non-condensable gases. We study this effect using a photochemical model coupled to a 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model in atmospheres with N2, CO2 and H2O as the main constituents. We find that in atmospheres with a low N2 inventory, water vapor mixing ratios in the middle atmosphere can be over two orders of magnitude higher compared to atmospheres with an Earth-like N2 inventory. Without a strong surface sink, the non-condensable oxygen can build up rapidly, drying out the upper atmosphere. With a moderate surface sink, the planet can approach a steady state with significant oxygen mixing ratios in which oxygen production is balanced by surface uptake. We use a radiative transfer model to study the spectroscopic fingerprint of these atmospheres in transit observations. Spectral signatures of abiotic oxygen and ozone can be of comparable magnitude as in spectra of Earth seen as an exoplanet. Middle atmospheric water vapor is unlikely to be a usable indicator of the abiotic origin of oxygen because of the influence of oxygen on the water vapor distribution. This suggests that atmospheric oxygen and ozone cannot be used as binary bioindicators and their interpretation will likely require atmospheric and planetary models.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaca36	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Rapid tissue oxygenation mapping from snapshot structured-light images
  with adversarial deep learning"	Mason T. Chen	Nicholas J. Durr	2020-07-01 21:14:05	Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a powerful technique for mapping tissue oxygen saturation over a wide field of view. However, current SFDI methods either require a sequence of several images with different illumination patterns or, in the case of single snapshot optical properties (SSOP), introduce artifacts and sacrifice accuracy. To avoid this tradeoff, we introduce OxyGAN: a data-driven, content-aware method to estimate tissue oxygenation directly from single structured light images using end-to-end generative adversarial networks. Conventional SFDI is used to obtain ground truth tissue oxygenation maps for ex vivo human esophagi, in vivo hands and feet, and an in vivo pig colon sample under 659 nm and 851 nm sinusoidal illumination. We benchmark OxyGAN by comparing to SSOP and to a two-step hybrid technique that uses a previously-developed deep learning model to predict optical properties followed by a physical model to calculate tissue oxygenation. When tested on human feet, a cross-validated OxyGAN maps tissue oxygenation with an accuracy of 96.5%. When applied to sample types not included in the training set, such as human hands and pig colon, OxyGAN achieves a 93.0% accuracy, demonstrating robustness to various tissue types. On average, OxyGAN outperforms SSOP and a hybrid model in estimating tissue oxygenation by 24.9% and 24.7%, respectively. Lastly, we optimize OxyGAN inference so that oxygenation maps are computed ~10 times faster than previous work, enabling video-rate, 25Hz imaging. Due to its rapid acquisition and processing speed, OxyGAN has the potential to enable real-time, high-fidelity tissue oxygenation mapping that may be useful for many clinical applications.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.25.11.112907	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Site-specific graph neural network for predicting protonation energy of
  oxygenate molecules"	Romit Maulik	Rajeev Surendran Array, Prasanna Balaprakash	2019-09-18 21:02:04	Bio-oil molecule assessment is essential for the sustainable development of chemicals and transportation fuels. These oxygenated molecules have adequate carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms that can be used for developing new value-added molecules (chemicals or transportation fuels). One motivation for our study stems from the fact that a liquid phase upgrading using mineral acid is a cost-effective chemical transformation. In this chemical upgrading process, adding a proton (positively charged atomic hydrogen) to an oxygen atom is a central step. The protonation energies of oxygen atoms in a molecule determine the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction and likely chemical reaction pathway. A quantum chemical model based on coupled cluster theory is used to compute accurate thermochemical properties such as the protonation energies of oxygen atoms and the feasibility of protonation-based chemical transformations. However, this method is too computationally expensive to explore a large space of chemical transformations. We develop a graph neural network approach for predicting protonation energies of oxygen atoms of hundreds of bioxygenate molecules to predict the feasibility of aqueous acidic reactions. Our approach relies on an iterative local nonlinear embedding that gradually leads to global influence of distant atoms and a output layer that predicts the protonation energy. Our approach is geared to site-specific predictions for individual oxygen atoms of a molecule in comparison with commonly used graph convolutional networks that focus on a singular molecular property prediction. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in learning the location and magnitudes of protonation energies of oxygenated molecules.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03136v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Stripes in oxygen-enriched cuprates	Manfred Bucher	Aucun	2020-10-11 21:37:09	Charge-order stripes of different types occur when copper oxides are doped with either heterovalent metal, like $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$, or oxygen, like $YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+y}$. The difference shows up in the doping dependence of their incommensurability: $q_c(x) \propto \sqrt{x-\check{p}}$ but $q_c(y) \approx 0.3$. The square-root dependence in the former compound family results from Coulomb repulsion between doped holes (or electrons), residing pairwise in lattice-site $O$ (or $Cu$) atoms of the $CuO_2$ planes. The almost constant $q_c(y)$ value in the second family results from the aggregation of ozone-like molecules, formed from $O^{2-}$ ions of the host with embedded oxygen atoms, $O_i$, at interstitial sites in the $CuO_2$ planes. The magnetic moments, $\mathbf{m}(O)$, of the lattice-defect $O$ atoms in the first family arrange antiferromagnetically, which gives rise to accompanying magnetization stripes of incommensurability $q_m(x) = q_c(x)/2$. The ozone complexes have a vanishing magnetic moment, $\mathbf{m}=0$, which explains the absence of accompanying magnetization stripes in the second family. Embedding excess oxygen as $O_i$ atoms in $CuO_2$ planes is likewise assumed for $HgBa_2CuO_{4+\delta}$ and oxygen-enriched bismuth cuprates. A combination of characteristics from both families is present in oxygen-enriched $La_2CuO_{4+y}$. The validity of determining the hole density in oxygen-enriched cuprates with the universal-dome method is independently confirmed. Besides causing different types of stripes, the two types of lattice-defect oxygen may also cause different types of superconductivity. This could explain the much higher $T_{c,max}$ in oxygen-enriched than $Sr$-doped cuprates, as well as the cusped cooling-curves of X-ray intensity diffracted by stripes in the former family.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06388v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Interdependent scaling of long-range oxygen and magnetic ordering in
  non-stoichiometric Nd${}_2$NiO${}_{4.10}$"	Sumit Ranjan Maity	Monica Ceretti, Lukas Keller, Jürg Schefer, Martin Meven, Ekaterina Pomjakushina, Werner Paulus	2021-01-12 17:55:16	Hole doping in Nd${}_{2}$NiO${}_{4.00}$ can be either achieved by substituting the trivalent Nd atoms by bivalent alkaline earth metals or by oxygen doping, yielding Nd${}_{2}$NiO${}_{4+\delta}$. In this study, we investigated the interplay between oxygen and spin ordering for a low oxygen doping concentration i.e. Nd${}_{2}$NiO${}_{4.10}$. Although the extra oxygen doping level remains rather modest with only one out of 20 possible interstitial tetrahedral lattice sites occupied, we observed by single crystal neutron diffraction the presence of a complex 3D modulated structure related to oxygen ordering already at ambient, the modulation vectors being $\pm$2/13\textit{\textbf{a*}}$\pm$3/13\textit{\textbf{b*}}, $\pm$3/13\textit{\textbf{b*}}$\pm$2/13\textit{\textbf{b*}} and $\pm$1/5\textit{\textbf{a*}}$\pm$1/2\textit{\textbf{c*}} and satellite reflections up to fourth order. Temperature dependent neutron diffraction studies indicate the coexistence of oxygen and magnetic ordering below T${}_{N}$ $\simeq$ 48 K, the wave vector of the Ni sublattice being \textbf{\textit{k}}=(100). In addition, magnetic satellite reflections adapt exactly the same modulation vectors as found for the oxygen ordering, evidencing a unique coexistence of 3D modulated ordering for spin and oxygen ordering in Nd${}_{2}$NiO${}_{4.10}$. Temperature dependent measurements of magnetic intensities suggest two magnetic phase transitions below 48 K and 20 K, indicating two distinct onsets of magnetic ordering for the Ni and Nd sublattice, respectively.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.5.014401	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"DFT Investigation of pH-Driven Oxygen Vacancy Formation-Annihilation in
  CeO2"	Hongyang Ma	Hangjuan Ren, Zhao Liu, Pramod Koshy, Charles C. Sorrell, Judy N. Hart	2021-04-22 11:14:08	There is considerable interest in the pH-dependent switchable biocatalytic properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeNPs) in biomedicine, where these materials exhibit beneficial antioxidant activity against reactive oxygen species at neutral and basic physiological pH but cytotoxic prooxidant activity at acidic pathological pH. Oxygen vacancies play a key role in such biocatalytic activities. While the general characteristics of the role of oxygen vacancies are known, the mechanism of their action at the atomic scale under different pH conditions has yet to be elucidated. The present work applies density functional theory (DFT) calculations to interpret the pH-induced behavior of the stable {111} surface of CeO2 at the atomic scale. Analysis of the surface-adsorbed media species reveals the critical role of pH on the reversibility of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ redox equilibria and the formation and annihilation of the oxygen vacancies. Under acidic conditions, this reversible switching is hindered owing to incomplete volumetric filling of the oxygen vacancies by the oxygen in the water molecules, hence effective retention of the oxygen vacancies, and consequent inhibition of redox biomimetic reactions. Under neutral and basic conditions, the capacity for this reversible switching is preserved due to complete filling of the oxygen vacancies by the OH ions owing to their ready size accommodation, thereby retaining the capacity for performing redox biomimetic reactions cyclically.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10992v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Pressure-induced metal-insulator transition in oxygen-deficient
  LiNbO$_3$-type ferroelectrics"	Chengliang Xia	Yue Chen, Hanghui Chen	2021-11-01 13:00:16	Hydrostatic pressure and oxygen vacancies usually have deleterious effects on ferroelectric materials because both tend to reduce their polarization. In this work we use first-principles calculations to study an important class of ferroelectric materials - LiNbO$_3$-type ferroelectrics (LiNbO$_3$ as the prototype), and find that in oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$, hydrostatic pressure induces an unexpected metal-insulator transition between 8 and 9 GPa. Our calculations also find that strong polar displacements persist in both metallic and insulating oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$ and the size of polar displacements is comparable to pristine LiNbO$_3$ under the same pressure. These properties are distinct from widely used perovskite ferroelectric oxide BaTiO$_3$, whose polarization is quickly suppressed by hydrostatic pressure and/or oxygen vacancies. The anomalous pressure-driven metal-insulator transition in oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$ arises from the change of an oxygen vacancy defect state. Hydrostatic pressure increases the polar displacements of oxygen-deficient LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$, which reduces the band width of the defect state and eventually turns it into an in-gap state. In the insulating phase, the in-gap state is further pushed away from the conduction band edge under hydrostatic pressure, which increases the fundamental gap. Our work shows that for LiNbO$_3$-type strong ferroelectrics, oxygen vacancies and hydrostatic pressure combined can lead to new phenomena and potential functions, in contrast to the harmful effects occurring to perovskite ferroelectric oxides such as BaTiO$_3$.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ac2e30	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Atomic oxygen abundance toward Sagittarius B2	Dariusz C. Lis	Paul F. Goldsmith, Rolf Güsten, Peter Schilke, Helmut Wiesemeyer, Youngmin Seo, Michael W. Werner	2023-01-09 19:44:27	A substantial fraction of oxygen in diffuse clouds is unaccounted for by observations and is postulated to be in an unknown refractory form, referred to as unidentified depleted oxygen (UDO), which, depending on the local gas density, may contribute up to 50% of the total oxygen content. Previous Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) observations suggest that a significant fraction of oxygen in even denser, translucent clouds may be in atomic form. We have analyzed velocity-resolved archival SOFIA observations of the 63 $\mu$m fine-structure [O I] transition toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(M) in the Central Molecular Zone. The foreground spiral-arm clouds as well as the extended Sgr B2 envelope between the Sun and the background dust continuum source produce multiple [O i] absorption components, spectrally separated in velocity space. The gas-phase atomic oxygen column density in foreground clouds toward Sgr B2 is well correlated with the total hydrogen column density, with an average atomic oxygen abundance of $(2.51 \pm 0.69) \times 10^{-4}$ with respect to hydrogen nuclei. This value is in good agreement with the earlier ISO measurements on the same line of sight, and is about 35% lower than the total interstellar medium oxygen abundance in the low-density warm gas, as measured in the UV. We find no evidence that a significant fraction of the oxygen on the line of sight toward Sagittarius B2 is in the form of UDO.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202245481	cs	arxiv					0.0

"The photospheric solar oxygen project: III. Investigation of the
  centre-to-limb variation of the 630nm [OI]-NiI blend"	E. Caffau	H. -G. Ludwig, M. Steffen, W. Livingston, P. Bonifacio, J. -M. Malherbe, H. -P. Doerr, W. Schmidt	2015-06-02 15:41:51	The solar photospheric abundance of oxygen is still a matter of debate. For about ten years some determinations have favoured a low oxygen abundance which is at variance with the value inferred by helioseismology. Among the oxygen abundance indicators, the forbidden line at 630nm has often been considered the most reliable even though it is blended with a NiI line. In Papers I and Paper II of this series we reported a discrepancy in the oxygen abundance derived from the 630nm and the subordinate [OI] line at 636nm in dwarf stars, including the Sun. Here we analyse several, in part new, solar observations of the the centre-to-limb variation of the spectral region including the blend at 630nm in order to separate the individual contributions of oxygen and nickel. We analyse intensity spectra observed at different limb angles in comparison with line formation computations performed on a CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the solar atmosphere. The oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line at different limb angles are inconsistent if the commonly adopted nickel abundance of 6.25 is assumed in our local thermodynamic equilibrium computations. With a slightly lower nickel abundance, A(Ni)~6.1, we obtain consistent fits indicating an oxygen abundance of A(O)=8.73+/-0.05. At this value the discrepancy with the subordinate oxygen line remains. The derived value of the oxygen abundance supports the notion of a rather low oxygen abundance in the solar hotosphere. However, it is disconcerting that the forbidden oxygen lines at 630 and 636nm give noticeably different results, and that the nickel abundance derived here from the 630nm blend is lower than expected from other nickel lines.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526331	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Excess oxygen in La_{2-x}Sr_xCoO_4	Manfred Bucher	Aucun	2017-12-22 22:35:06	The amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen in La_{2-x}Sr_xCoO_{4+y} is calculated from Sr doping, x, and the measured stripe incommensurability 2delta for x = 1/4 and x = 1/3 based on a linear or square-root dependence of delta(x, y). The results favor the square-root dependence and indicate that the range of excess oxygen extends to x < 0.4 instead of to x < 0.3 as previously thought, coinciding with the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08676v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Geometry and quantum delocalization of interstitial oxygen in silicon	Emilio Artacho	Arturo Lizon-Nordstrom, Felix Yndurain	1994-12-15 18:38:04	The problem of the geometry of interstitial oxygen in silicon is settled by proper consideration of the quantum delocalization of the oxygen atom around the bond-center position. The calculated infrared absorption spectrum accounts for the 517 and 1136 cm$^{-1}$ bands in their position, character, and isotope shifts. The asymmetric lineshape of the 517 cm$^{-1}$ peak is also well reproduced. A new, non-infrared-active, symmetric-stretching mode is found at 596 cm$^{-1}$. First-principles calculations are presented supporting the nontrivial quantum delocalization of the oxygen atom.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.51.7862	cs	arxiv					0.0

Achieving fast oxygen diffusion in perovskites by cation ordering	A. A. Taskin	A. N. Lavrov, Yoichi Ando	2005-01-07 02:51:47	The oxygen-exchange behavior has been studied in half-doped manganese and cobalt perovskite oxides. We have found that the oxygen diffusivity in Gd_{0.5}Ba_{0.5}MnO_{3-\delta} can be enhanced by orders of magnitude by inducing crystallographic ordering among lanthanide and alkali-earth ions in the A-site sublattice. Transformation of a simple cubic perovskite, with randomly occupied A-sites, into a layered crystal GdBaMn_2O_{5+x} (or isostructural GdBaCo_2O_{5+x} for cobalt oxide) with alternating lanthanide and alkali-earth planes reduces the oxygen bonding strength and provides disorder-free channels for ion motion, pointing to an efficient way to design new ionic conductors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1864244	cs	arxiv					0.0

Comparisons between x = 0.17 samples subjected to either ion-irradiation or oxygenation demonstrate that changing the oxygen content has two separable effects: 1) a doping effect similar to that of cerium, and 2) a disorder effect. These results are consistent with prior speculations that apical oxygen removal is necessary to achieve superconductivity in this compound.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.104510	cs	arxiv					0.0

In the A-site ordered structure, oxygen vacancies order, and d = 0.34 sample shows a weak ferromagnetic transition beyond 300 K. On the other hand, in the A-site disordered structure, no oxygen vacancy ordering is observed, and d = 0.16 sample shows a ferromagnetic metallic transition around 150 K. A-site disordering destroys the orderings of oxygen-vacancies and orbitals, leading to the strong modification of the electronic phases.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2830615	cs	arxiv					0.0

The optimized thin film samples are semiconducting and ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature close to 100 K, a coercive field of 1200 Oe, and a saturation magnetization of 1.7muB per formula unit. The surface texture, structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the LaRh1/2Mn1/2O3 films was examined as a function of the oxygen concentration during deposition. While an elevated oxygen concentration yields thin films with optimal magnetic properties, slightly lower oxygen concentrations result in films with improved texture and crystallinity.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3068174	cs	arxiv					0.0

The UCN production in solid \alpha-oxygen is dominated by the excitation of phonons. The contribution of magnons to UCN production becomes only slightly important above E >10 meV and at E >4 meV. Solid \alpha-oxygen is in comparison to solid deuterium less effcient in the down-scattering of thermal or cold neutrons into the UCN energy regime.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/96/62001	cs	arxiv					0.0

The zero resistivity appeared and reached 8.5 K by the oxygen annealing at 200\degree C. The superconducting volume fraction was also enhanced from 0 to almost 100%. The lattice constants were compressed by the oxygen annealing, indicating that the evolution of bulk superconductivity in FeTe0.8S0.2 was correlated to the shrinkage of lattice.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/90/57002	cs	arxiv					0.0

The partial substitution of Te by S suppresses antiferromagnetism in Fe-square lattice. Superconductivity is induced by oxygen annealing for only FeTe1-xSx in which the long-range magnetic ordering is suppressed. To realize superconductivity in FeTe1-xSx, both S concentration enough to suppress antiferromagnetism and oxygen annealing are required.

Ferromagnetic coupling of encapsulated oxygen produces a magnetic field with cylindrical symmetry, which deviates the electron's eigenenergies from those prior to the oxygen absorption. An intriguing spectral gap arises near the Fermi energy, at which the gap formation is allowed only when the tube length equals to a multiple of three in units of carbon hexagon.

Using density functional theory within the GGA$+U$ approximation we calculate the dependence of the oxygen vacancy formation energy on the biaxial strain conditions. We find that the change in formation energy with strain is negligible over the range of strain values usually accessible through coherent epitaxial growth. Our findings suggest that experimental reports of different oxygen vacancy concentrations in strained films result from extrinsic factors, or from other impurities such as defect complexes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1431v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Cumulative Oxygen Abundances of Spiral Galaxies	Stuart Dack	Marshall L. McCall	2012-04-08 16:52:23	Studying the global evolution of spiral galaxies requires determining their overall chemical compositions. However, since spirals tend to possess gradients in their chemical compositions, determining their overall chemical abundances poses a challenge. In this study, the framework for a newly proposed method for determining the overall oxygen abundance of a disk is established. By separately integrating the absolute amounts of hydrogen and oxygen out to large radii, the cumulative oxygen abundance is shown to approach an asymptotic value. In this manner, a reliable account of the overall chemical state of a disk is revealed.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/167	cs	arxiv					0.0

Plummer	2016-08-28 06:05:18	An unusual Fe-H bonding rather than conventional OH bonding is identified at Fe3O4 (001) surface. This abnormal behavior is associated with the oxygen vacancies which exist on the surface region but also penetrate deep into the bulk Fe3O4. In contrast, OH bonding becomes preferential as generally expected on an ozone processed surface, which has appreciably less oxygen vacancies. Such bonding site selective behavior, depending on oxygen vacancy concentrations, is further confirmed with DFT calculations.

Thomas-Fermi model yields condensed phase of molecular metallic oxygen	Yuri Kornyushin	Aucun	2008-03-04 08:32:11	Calculations, performed in Thomas-Fermi approximation, show that the energy of a condensed phase of molecular metallic oxygen is lower by 496 kJ/mol than that of an insulator oxygen phase. The insulator phase is separated from a metallic one by energetic barrier of 1165 kJ/mol. This barrier could be overcome by means of electromagnetic irradiation with quantum energy of 12.071 eV or a bit higher. During such a transition the amount of energy equal to 496 kJ/mol is released.

Yet electrolyte degradation takes place much more severe for SOEC than SOFC during long-term operations. By solving transport equations, we found very large oxygen potential gradients and sharp oxygen potential transitions at grain boundaries of polycrystalline SOFC/SOEC electrolyte. Surprisingly, an inversion of oxygen potential transitions was identified, suggesting a fundamentally different transport mechanism for minor electronic charge carriers. Such findings could be critical to understand and eliminate SOFC/SOEC degradations in practical applications.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09016v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Polarity-induced oxygen vacancies at LaAlO3|SrTiO3 interfaces	Zhicheng Zhong	P. X. Xu, Paul J. Kelly	2010-06-26 14:39:17	Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we find a strong position and thickness dependence of the formation energy of oxygen vacancies in LaAlO3|SrTiO3 (LAO|STO) multilayers and interpret this with an analytical capacitor model. Oxygen vacancies are preferentially formed at p-type SrO|AlO2 rather than at n-type LaO|TiO2 interfaces; the excess electrons introduced by the oxygen vacancies reduce their energy by moving to the n-type interface. This asymmetric behavior makes an important contribution to the conducting (insulating) nature of n-type (p-type) interfaces while providing a natural explanation for the failure to detect evidence for the polar catastrophe in the form of core level shifts.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.82.165127	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The formation of ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs and their

Camisassa, Santiago Torres, Jordi Gutierrez, Alberto Rebassa-Mansergas	2020-11-20 15:05:32	(Abridged abstract) We explore the formation of ultra-massive (M_{\rm WD} \gtrsim 1.05 M_\sun$), carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs resulting from single stellar evolution. We also study their evolutionary and pulsational properties and compare them with those of the ultra-massive white dwarfs with oxygen-neon cores resulting from carbon burning in single progenitor stars, and with binary merger predictions. We consider two single-star evolution scenarios for the formation of ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs that involve rotation of the degenerate core after core helium burning and reduced mass-loss rates in massive asymptotic giant-branch stars. We compare our findings with the predictions from ultra-massive white dwarfs resulting from the merger of two equal-mass carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs, by assuming complete mixing between them and a carbon-oxygen core for the merged remnant. The resulting ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs evolve markedly slower than their oxygen-neon counterparts. Our study strongly suggests the formation of ultra-massive white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen core from single stellar evolution. We find that both the evolutionary and pulsation properties of these white dwarfs are markedly different from those of their oxygen-neon core counterparts and from those white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen core that might result from double degenerate mergers. This can eventually be used to discern the core composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs and their formation scenario.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202038930	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Does FLASH deplete Oxygen? Experimental Evaluation for Photons, Protons
  and Carbon Ions"	Jeannette Jansen	Jan Knoll, Elke Beyreuther, Jörg Pawelke, Raphael Skuza, Rachel Hanley, Stephan Brons, Francesca Pagliari, Joao Seco	2021-02-25 10:09:12	Purpose: To investigate experimentally, if FLASH irradiation depletes oxygen within water for different radiation types such as photons, protons and carbon ions.   Methods: This study presents measurements of the oxygen consumption in sealed, 3D printed water phantoms during irradiation with X-rays, protons and carbon ions at varying dose rates up to 340 Gy/s. The oxygen measurement was performed using an optical sensor allowing for non-invasive measurements.   Results: Oxygen consumption in water only depends on dose, dose rate and linear energy transfer (LET) of the irradiation. The total amount of oxygen depleted per 10 Gy was found to be 0.04 - 0.18 % atm for 225 kV photons, 0.04 - 0.25 % atm for 224 MeV protons and 0.09 - 0.17 % atm for carbon ions. consumption depends on dose rate by an inverse power law and saturates for higher dose rates because of self-interactions of radicals. Higher dose rates yield lower oxygen consumption. No total depletion of oxygen was found for clinical doses.   Conclusions: FLASH irradiation does consume oxygen, but not enough to deplete all the oxygen present. For higher dose rates, less oxygen was consumed than at standard radiotherapy dose rates. No total depletion was found for any of the analyzed radiation types for 10 Gy dose delivery using FLASH.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mp.14917	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"First-principles studies of oxygen interstitial dopants in RbPbI$_3$
  halide for perovskite solar cells"	Chongyao Yang	Wei Wu, Kwang-Leong Choy	2023-02-08 09:36:59	Recent research on perovskite solar cells has caught much attention for the application in renewable energy materials. However, the effect of external dopants on the performance of perovskite solar cell is yet to be understood properly. Oxygen atom or molecule is important dopant to influence the stability of structural, electronic and optical properties as well as the performance of perovskite solar cells. RbPbX3-type perovskites have fantastic chemical stability and good power conversion efficiency. Here for the first time, we have studied the effect of interstitial oxygen atom (O1) and molecule (O2) on the structural properties, and hence the electronic structure of RbPbI3 from first principles. A significant reduction of the band gap from ~2.6 eV to ~ 1.0 eV, which is close to the optimal band gap, has been predicted when incorporating oxygen. This could in turn be applied to improve the optical properties for harvesting light if we can control the oxygen level appropriately. In addition, an exotic metallic state has been found in our calculations for interstitial oxygen molecule when there are strong O-O, O-Pb, and O-I bonds, indicating the complex nature of oxygen-doped perovskite solar cells. The comparison between oxygen atom and molecules is consistent with the previous report about oxygen-molecule passivation of perovskite solar cells. This indicated oxygen incorporation can not only improve efficiency and stability but also facilitate the optimal band-gap engineering. Our work has therefore provided an important and timely theoretical insight to the effect of oxygen dopants in perovskite solar cells. Moreover, these results also provide theoretical foundation for further simulations such as molecular dynamics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03962v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On the oxygen abundance determination in HII regions: High - metallicity
  regions"	L. S. Pilyugin	Aucun	2001-01-25 08:33:15	"This is our second paper devoted to the problem of line intensity - oxygen abundance calibration starting from the idea of McGaugh (1991) that the strong oxygen lines contain the necessary information to determine accurate abundances in HII regions. The high-metallicity HII regions are considered.   A relation of the type O/H=f(P,R23) between oxygen abundance and the value of abundance index R23 introduced by Pagel et al. (1979) and the excitation parameter P (which is defined here as the contribution of the radiation in [OIII]4959,5007 lines to the ""total"" oxygen radiation) has been derived empirically using the available oxygen abundances determined via measurement of a temperature-sensitive line ratio [OIII]4959,5007/[OIII]4363 (Te - method). By comparing oxygen abundances derived with the Te - method and those derived with the suggested relations (P - method), it was found that the precision of oxygen abundance determination with the P - method is around 0.1 dex and is comparable to that of the Te - method.   A relation of the type Te=f(P,R23) between electron temperature and the values of abundance index R23 and the excitation parameter P was derived empirically using the available electron temperatures determined via measurement of temperature-sensitive line ratios. The mean difference between electron temperatures derived through the Te=f(P,23 relation and determined via measurement of the temperature-sensitive line ratio is around 500K."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20010079	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On the oxygen abundance in our Galaxy	L. S. Pilyugin	F. Ferrini, R. V. Shkvarun	2003-02-03 09:57:04	The compilation of published spectra of Galactic HII regions with available diagnostic [OIII]4363 line has been carried out. Our list contains 71 individual measurements of 13 HII regions in the range of galactocentric distances from 6.6 to 14.8 kpc. The oxygen abundances in all the HII regions were recomputed in the same way, using the classic Te - method. The oxygen abundance at the solar galactocentric distance traced by those HII regions is in agreement with the oxygen abundance in the interstellar medium in the solar vicinity derived with high precision from the interstellar absorption lines towards stars. The derived radial oxygen abundance distribution was compared with that for HII regions from the Shaver et al. (1983) sample which is the basis of many models for the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. It was found that the original Shaver et al.'s oxygen abundances are overestimated by 0.2-0.3 dex. Oxygen abundances in HII regions from the Shaver et al. sample have been redetermined with the recently suggested P - method. The radial distribution of oxygen abundances from the Shaver et al. sample redetermined with the P - method is in agreement with our radial distribution of (O/H)_Te abundances.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20030139	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen non-stoichiometry in Ru-1212 and Ru-1222 magnetosuperconductors	M. Matvejeff	V. P. S. Awana, L. -Y. Jang, R. S. Liu, H. Yamauchi, M. Karppinen	2002-11-06 07:11:17	Here we report the results of thermogravimetric (TG) analysis on the oxygen non-stoichiometry of RuSr2GdCu2O8 (Ru-1212) and RuSr2(Gd0.75Ce0.25)2Cu2O10(Ru-1222) samples. With TG annealings carried out in O2 and Ar atmospheres it was found that the oxygen content in Ru-1212 remains less affected upon various annealings, while for Ru-1222 wider-range oxygen-content tuning is possible. When heated in H2/Ar atmosphere the both phases release oxygen upon breaking down to mixtures of metals (Ru and Cu) and binary oxides (CeO2, Gd2O3, and SrO) in two distinct steps around 300 and 450 oC. This reductive decomposition reaction carried out in a thermobalance was utilized in precise oxygen content determination for these phases. It was found that the 100-atm O2-annealed Ru-1212 sample was nearly stoichiometric, while the similarly treated Ru-1222 sample was clearly oxygen deficient. X-ray absorption near-edge (XANES) spectroscopy was applied to estimate the valence of Ru in the samples. In spite of the fact that the Ru-1212 phase was shown to possess less oxygen-deficient RuO2 layer, the valence of Ru as probed with XANES was found to be lower in Ru-1212 than that in Ru-1222.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4534(03)01067-0	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Ab initio study of charge transport through single oxygen molecules in
  atomic aluminum contacts"	S. Wohlthat	F. Pauly, J. K. Viljas, J. C. Cuevas, Gerd Schön	2007-02-20 21:28:55	We present ab initio calculations of transport properties of atomic-sized aluminum contacts in the presence of oxygen. The experimental situation is modeled by considering a single oxygen atom (O) or one of the molecules O2 and O3 bridging the gap between electrodes forming ideal, atomically sharp pyramids. The transport characteristics are computed for these geometries with increasing distances between the leads, simulating the opening of a break junction. To facilitate comparison with experiments further, the vibrational modes of the oxygen connected to the electrodes are studied. It is found that in the contact regime the change of transport properties due to the presence of oxygen is strong and should be detectable in experiments. All three types of oxygen exhibit a comparable behavior in their vibrational frequencies and conductances, which are well below the conductance of pure aluminum atomic contacts. The conductance decreases for an increasing number of oxygen atoms. In the tunneling regime the conductance decays exponentially with distance and the decay length depends on whether or not oxygen is present in the junction. This fact may provide a way to identify the presence of a gas molecule in metallic atomic contacts.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.76.075413	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Oxygen depletion in dense molecular clouds: a clue to a low O2
  abundance?"	U. Hincelin	V. Wakelam, F. Hersant, S. Guilloteau, J. C. Loison, P. Honvault, J. Troe	2011-04-08 09:23:36	Context: Dark cloud chemical models usually predict large amounts of O2, often above observational limits. Aims: We investigate the reason for this discrepancy from a theoretical point of view, inspired by the studies of Jenkins and Whittet on oxygen depletion. Methods: We use the gas-grain code Nautilus with an up-to-date gas-phase network to study the sensitivity of the molecular oxygen abundance to the oxygen elemental abundance. We use the rate coefficient for the reaction O + OH at 10 K recommended by the KIDA (KInetic Database for Astrochemistry) experts. Results: The updates of rate coefficients and branching ratios of the reactions of our gas-phase chemical network, especially N + CN and H3+ + O, have changed the model sensitivity to the oxygen elemental abundance. In addition, the gas-phase abundances calculated with our gas-grain model are less sensitive to the elemental C/O ratio than those computed with a pure gas-phase model. The grain surface chemistry plays the role of a buffer absorbing most of the extra carbon. Finally, to reproduce the low abundance of molecular oxygen observed in dark clouds at all times, we need an oxygen elemental abundance smaller than 1.6E-4. Conclusion: The chemistry of molecular oxygen in dense clouds is quite sensitive to model parameters that are not necessarily well constrained. That O2 abundance may be sensitive to nitrogen chemistry is an indication of the complexity of interstellar chemistry.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201016328	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Enhancement of the Electron Spin Resonance of Single-Walled Carbon
  Nanotubes by Oxygen Removal"	W. D. Rice	R. T. Weber, A. D. Leonard, J. M. Tour, P. Nikolaev, S. Arepalli, V. Berka, A. -L. Tsai, J. Kono	2011-10-24 13:06:21	We have observed a nearly fourfold increase in the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal from an ensemble of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) due to oxygen desorption. By performing temperature-dependent ESR spectroscopy both before and after thermal annealing, we found that the ESR in SWCNTs can be reversibly altered via the molecular oxygen content in the samples. Independent of the presence of adsorbed oxygen, a Curie-law (spin susceptibility $\propto 1/T$) is seen from $\sim$4 K to 300 K, indicating that the probed spins are finite-level species. For both the pre-annealed and post-annealed sample conditions, the ESR linewidth decreased as the temperature was increased, a phenomenon we identify as motional narrowing. From the temperature dependence of the linewidth, we extracted an estimate of the intertube hopping frequency; for both sample conditions, we found this hopping frequency to be $\sim$100 GHz. Since the spin hopping frequency changes only slightly when oxygen is desorbed, we conclude that only the spin susceptibility, not spin transport, is affected by the presence of physisorbed molecular oxygen in SWCNT ensembles. Surprisingly, no linewidth change is observed when the amount of oxygen in the SWCNT sample is altered, contrary to other carbonaceous systems and certain 1D conducting polymers. We hypothesize that physisorbed molecular oxygen acts as an acceptor ($p$-type), compensating the donor-like ($n$-type) defects that are responsible for the ESR signal in bulk SWCNTs.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn204094s	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Spiral Chain O4 Form of Dense Oxygen	Li Zhu	Ziwei Wang, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma, Guangtian Zou, Ho-kwang Mao	2011-11-09 04:41:02	Oxygen is in many ways a unique element: the only known diatomic molecular magnet and the capability of stabilization of the hitherto unexpected O8 cluster structure in its solid form at high pressure. Molecular dissociations upon compression as one of the fundamental problems were reported for other diatomic solids (e.g., H2, I2, Br2, and N2), but it remains elusive for solid oxygen, making oxygen an intractable system. We here report the theoretical prediction on the dissociation of molecular oxygen into a polymeric spiral chain O4 structure (\theta-O4) by using first-principles calypso method on crystal structure prediction. The \theta-O4 stabilizes above 2 TPa and has been observed as the third high pressure phase of sulfur (S-III). We find that the molecular O8 phase remains extremely stable in a large pressure range of 0.008 - 2 TPa, whose breakdown is driven by the pressure-induced instability of a transverse acoustic phonon mode at zone boundary, leading to the ultimate formation of \theta-O4. Remarkably, stabilization of \theta-O4 turns oxygen from a superconductor into an insulator with a wide band gap (approximately 5.9 eV) originating from the sp3-like hybridized orbitals of oxygen and the localization of valence electrons.

"Oxygen abundances in low- and high-alpha field halo stars and the
  discovery of two field stars born in globular clusters"	I. Ramirez	J. Melendez, J. Chaname	2012-08-17 20:00:02	Oxygen abundances of 67 dwarf stars in the metallicity range -1.6<[Fe/H]<-0.4 are derived from a non-LTE analysis of the 777 nm O I triplet lines. These stars have precise atmospheric parameters measured by Nissen and Schuster, who find that they separate into three groups based on their kinematics and alpha-element (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) abundances: thick-disk, high-alpha halo, and low-alpha halo. We find the oxygen abundance trends of thick-disk and high-alpha halo stars very similar. The low-alpha stars show a larger star-to-star scatter in [O/Fe] at a given [Fe/H] and have systematically lower oxygen abundances compared to the other two groups. Thus, we find the behavior of oxygen abundances in these groups of stars similar to that of the alpha elements. We use previously published oxygen abundance data of disk and very metal-poor halo stars to present an overall view (-2.3<[Fe/H]<+0.3) of oxygen abundance trends of stars in the solar neighborhood. Two field halo dwarf stars stand out in their O and Na abundances. Both G53-41 and G150-40 have very low oxygen and very high sodium abundances, which are key signatures of the abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster (GC) stars. Therefore, they are likely field halo stars born in GCs. If true, we estimate that at least 3+/-2% of the local field metal-poor star population was born in GCs.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/757/2/164	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Persistent metal-insulator transition at the surface of an
  oxygen-deficient, epitaxial manganite film"	Paul C. Snijders	Min Gao, Hangwen Guo, Guixin Cao, Wolter Siemons, Hongjun Gao, Thomas Z. Ward, Jian Shen, Zheng Gai	2014-01-28 14:53:31	The oxygen stoichiometry has a large influence on the physical and chemical properties of complex oxides. Most of the functionality in e.g. catalysis and electrochemistry depends in particular on control of the oxygen stoichiometry. In order to understand the fundamental properties of intrinsic surfaces of oxygen-deficient complex oxides, we report on in situ temperature dependent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy experiments on pristine oxygen deficient, epitaxial manganite films. Although these films are insulating in subsequent ex situ in-plane electronic transport experiments at all temperatures, in situ scanning tunnelling spectroscopic data reveal that the surface of these films exhibits a metal-insulator transition (MIT) at 120 K, coincident with the onset of ferromagnetic ordering of small clusters in the bulk of the oxygen-deficient film. The surprising proximity of the surface MIT transition temperature of nonstoichiometric films with that of the fully oxygenated bulk suggests that the electronic properties in the surface region are not significantly affected by oxygen deficiency in the bulk. This carries important implications for the understanding and functional design of complex oxides and their interfaces with specific electronic properties for catalysis, oxide electronics and electrochemistry.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3nr02343e	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Prospects for Detecting Oxygen, Water, and Chlorophyll on an Exo-Earth	Timothy D. Brandt	David S. Spiegel	2014-04-21 21:23:20	The goal of finding and characterizing nearby Earth-like planets is driving many NASA high-contrast flagship mission concepts, the latest of which is known as the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST). In this article, we calculate the optimal spectral resolution $R=\lambda/\delta\lambda$ and minimum signal-to-noise ratio per spectral bin (SNR), two central design requirements for a high-contrast space mission, in order to detect signatures of water, oxygen, and chlorophyll on an Earth twin. We first develop a minimally parametric model and demonstrate its ability to fit synthetic and observed Earth spectra; this allows us to measure the statistical evidence for each component's presence. We find that water is the easiest to detect, requiring a resolution $R \gtrsim 20$, while the optimal resolution for oxygen is likely to be closer to $R = 150$, somewhat higher than the canonical value in the literature. At these resolutions, detecting oxygen will require $\sim$2 times the SNR as water. Chlorophyll requires $\sim$6 times the SNR as oxygen for an Earth twin, only falling to oxygen-like levels of detectability for a low cloud cover and/or a large vegetation covering fraction. This suggests designing a mission for sensitivity to oxygen and adopting a multi-tiered observing strategy, first targeting water, then oxygen on the more favorable planets, and finally chlorophyll on only the most promising worlds.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1407296111	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Oxygen diffusion pathways in brownmillerite SrCoO2.5: Influence of
  structure and chemical potential"	Chandrima Mitra	Tricia Meyer, Ho Nyung Lee, Fernando A. Reboredo	2014-08-29 17:18:10	To design and discover new materials for next-generation energy materials such as solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a fundamental understanding of their ionic properties and behaviors is essential. The potential applicability of a material for SOFCs is critically determined by the activation energy barrier of oxygen along various diffusion pathways. In this work, we investigate interstitial-oxygen (Oi) diffusion in brownmillerite oxide SrCoO2.5, employing a first-principles approach. Our calculations indicate highly anisotropic ionic diffusion pathways, which result from its anisotropic crystal structure. The one-dimensional-ordered oxygen vacancy channels are found to provide the easiest diffusion pathway with an activation energy barrier height of 0.62 eV. The directions perpendicular to the vacancy channels have higher energy barriers for Oint diffusion. In addition, we have studied migration barriers for oxygen vacancies that could be present as point defects within the material. This in turn could also facilitate the transport of oxygen. Interestingly, for oxygen vacancies, the lowest barrier height was found to occur within the octahedral layer with an energy of 0.82 eV. Our results imply that interstitial migration would be highly one-dimensional in nature. Oxygen vacancy transport, on the other hand, could preferentially occur in the two-dimensional octahedral plane.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4893950	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Chromospheric Models and the Oxygen Abundance in Giant Stars	A. K. Dupree	E. H. Avrett, R. L. Kurucz	2016-03-23 22:39:54	Realistic stellar atmospheric models of two typical metal-poor giant stars in Omega Centauri that include a chromosphere influence the formation of optical lines of Oxygen I: the forbidden lines (630nm, 636nm) and the infrared triplet (777.1-777.5 nm). One-dimensional semi-empirical non-LTE models are constructed based on observed Balmer lines. A full non-LTE formulation is applied in evaluating line strengths of O I including photoionization by the Lyman continuum and photoexcitation by Ly-alpha and Ly-beta. Chromospheric models (CHR) yield forbidden oxygen transitions that are stronger than in radiative/convective equilibrium (RCE) models. The triplet oxygen lines from high levels also appear stronger than produced in an RCE model. The inferred oxygen abundance from realistic CHR models for these two stars is decreased by factors ~3 as compared to values derived from RCE models. A lower oxygen abundance suggests that intermediate mass AGB stars contribute to the observed abundance pattern in globular clusters. A change in the oxygen abundance of metal-poor field giants could affect models of deep mixing episodes on the red giant branch. Changes in the oxygen abundance can impact other abundance determinations critical to astrophysics including chemical tagging techniques and galactic chemical evolution.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/2041-8205/821/1/L7	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Systematic spatial and stoichiometric screening towards understanding
  the surface of ultrasmall oxygenated silicon nanocrystal"	Shanawer Niaz	Aristides D. Zdetsis, Emmanuel N. Koukaras, Oguz Gulseren, Imran Sadiq	2016-04-12 19:08:27	In most of the realistic ab initio and model calculations which have appeared on the emission of light from Si nanocrystals, the role of surface oxygen has been usually ignored, underestimated or completely ruled out. We investigate theoretically, by density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) possible modes of oxygen bonding in hydrogen terminated silicon quantum dots using as a representative case of the Si29 nanocrystal. We have considered Bridge-bonded oxygen (BBO), Doubly-bonded oxygen (DBO), hydroxyl (OH) and Mix of these oxidizing agents. Due to stoichiometry, all comparisons performed are unbiased with respect to composition whereas spatial distribution of oxygen species pointed out drastic change in electronic and cohesive characteristics of nanocrytals. From an overall perspective of this study, it is shown that bridge bonded oxygenated nanocrystals accompanied by Mix have higher binding energies and large electronic gap compared to nanocrystals with doubly bonded oxygen atoms. In addition, it is observed that the presence of OH along with BBO, DBO and mixed configurations further lowers electronic gaps and binding energies and trends. It is also demonstrated that oxidizing constituent besides their spatial distribution significantly alters binding energy and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap (HOMO-LUMO gap up to 1.48 eV) within same composition.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.06.197	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Spectroscopic Signature of Oxidized Oxygen States in Peroxides	Zengqing Zhuo	Chaitanya Das Pemmaraju, John Vinson, Chunjing Jia, Brian Moritz, Ilkyu Lee, Shawn Sallies, Qinghao Li, Jinpeng Wu, Kehua Dai, Yi-de Chuang, Zahid Hussain, Feng Pan, Thomas P. Devereaux, Wanli Yang	2018-09-21 20:02:03	Recent debates on the oxygen redox behaviors in battery electrodes have triggered a pressing demand for the reliable detection and understanding of non-divalent oxygen states beyond conventional absorption spectroscopy. Here, enabled by high-efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) coupled with first-principles calculations, we report distinct mRIXS features of the oxygen states in Li2O, Li2CO3, and especially, Li2O2, which are successfully reproduced and interpreted theoretically. mRIXS signals are dominated by valence-band decays in Li2O and Li2CO3. However, the oxidized oxygen in Li2O2 leads to partially unoccupied O-2p states that yield a specific intra-band excitonic feature in mRIXS. Such a feature displays a specific emission energy in mRIXS, which disentangles the oxidized oxygen states from the dominating transition-metal/oxygen hybridization features in absorption spectroscopy, thus providing critical hints for both detecting and understanding the oxygen redox reactions in transition-metal oxide based battery materials.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02757	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Fingerprint oxygen redox reactions in batteries through high-efficiency
  mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS)"	Jinpeng Wu	Qinghao Li, Shawn Sallis, Zengqing Zhuo, William E. Gent, William C. Chueh, Shishen Yan, Yi-de Chuang, Wanli Yang	2018-12-22 19:41:37	Realizing reversible reduction-oxidation (Redox) reactions of lattice oxygen in batteries is a promising way to improve the energy and power density. However, conventional oxygen absorption spectroscopy fails to distinguish the critical oxygen chemistry in oxide-based battery electrodes. Therefore, high-efficiency full-range mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) has been developed as a reliable probe of oxygen redox reactions. Here, based on mRIXS results collected from a series of Li1.17Ni0.21Co0.08Mn0.54O2 electrodes at different electrochemical states and its comparison with peroxides, we provide a comprehensive analysis of five components observed in the mRIXS results. While almost all the components change upon electrochemical cycling, comparison with peroxide species show that only two evolving features correspond to the critical oxidized oxygen states. One is a specific feature at 531.0eV excitation and 523.7eV emission energy, the other is a low-energy loss feature. We show that both features evolve with electrochemical cycling of Li1.17Ni0.21Co0.08Mn0.54O2 electrodes, and could be used for characterizing oxygen redox states in battery electrodes. This work is the first benchmark for a complete assignment of all the important mRIXS features collected from battery materials, which provides guidelines for future studies in characterization, analysis and theoretical calculation for probing and understanding oxygen redox reactions.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/condmat4010005	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Oxygen in the early Galaxy: OH lines as tracers of oxygen abundance in
  extremely metal-poor giant stars"	A. Kucinskas	V. Dobrovolskas, P. Bonifacio, E. Caffau, H. -G. Ludwig, M. Steffen, M. Spite	2014-09-10 16:57:53	Oxygen is a powerful tracer element of Galactic chemical evolution. Unfortunately, only a few oxygen lines are available in the ultraviolet-infrared stellar spectra for the reliable determination of its abundance. Moreover, oxygen abundances obtained using different spectral lines often disagree significantly. In this contribution we therefore investigate whether the inadequate treatment of convection in 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres used in the abundance determinations may be responsible for this disagreement. For this purpose, we used VLT CRIRES spectra of three EMP giants, as well as 3D hydrodynamical CO$^5$BOLD and 1D hydrostatic LHD model atmospheres, to investigate the role of convection in the formation of infrared (IR) OH lines. Our results show that the presence of convection leads to significantly stronger IR OH lines. As a result, the difference in the oxygen abundance determined from IR OH lines with 3D hydrodynamical and classical 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres may reach -0.2 ... -0.3 dex. In case of the three EMP giants studied here, we obtain a good agrement between the 3D LTE oxygen abundances determined by us using vibrational-rotational IR OH lines in the spectral range of 1514-1626 nm, and oxygen abundances determined from forbidden [O I] 630 nm line in previous studies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3153v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Electronic structure of HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$ with self-organized
  interstitial oxygen wires in the Hg spacer planes"	Thomas Jarlborg	Antonio Bianconi	2017-11-14 16:31:50	While recent experiments have found that at optimum doping for the highest critical temperature in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (Hg1201) the oxygen interstitials (O-i) are not homogeneously distributed but form one-dimensional atomic wires, there are no available information of its electronic structure considering self-organized O-i atomic wires. Here we report the calculated electronic structure of HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ where oxygen interstitials form atomic wires along (1,0,0) crystal direction in the Hg layer. We find that at optimum doping for superconductivity the chemical potential is tuned near an electronic topological Lifshitz transition for the appearing of a second quasi 1D Fermi surface. A $first$ large Fermi surface coexists with a $second$ incipient quasi one dimensional (1D) Fermi surface related with atomic wires of oxygen interstitials. Increasing oxygen doping the chemical potential is driven to the band edge of the $second$ 1D-band giving a peak in the density-of-states. The new 1D electronic states are confined near the oxygen interstitial wires with a small spread only on nearby sites. Spin-polarized calculations show that the magnetic response is confined in the oxygen-poor domains free of oxygen interstitials wires and it is quite insensitive to the density of O-i wires.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10948-017-4453-2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Anisotropic Proton and Oxygen Ion Conductivity in Epitaxial Ba2In2O5
  Thin Films"	Aline Fluri	Maths Karlsson, Marco Bettinelli, Ivano E. Castelli, Thomas Lippert, Daniele Pergolesi	2019-05-03 11:02:29	Solid oxide oxygen ion and proton conductors are a highly important class of materials for renewable energy conversion devices like solid oxide fuel cells. Ba2In2O5 (BIO) exhibits both oxygen ion and proton conduction, in dry and humid environment, respectively. In dry environment, the brownmillerite crystal structure of BIO exhibits an ordered oxygen ion sublattice, which has been speculated to result in anisotropic oxygen ion conduction. The hydrated structure of BIO, however, resembles a perovskite and the protons in it were predicted to be ordered in layers. To complement the significant theoretical and experimental efforts recently reported on the potentially anisotropic conductive properties in BIO, we measure here the proton and oxygen ion conductivity along different crystallographic directions. Using epitaxial thin films with different crystallographic orientations the charge transport for both charge carriers is shown to be anisotropic. The anisotropy of the oxygen ion conduction can indeed be explained through the layered structure of the oxygen sublattice in brownmillerite BIO. The anisotropic proton conduction however, further supports the suggested ordering of the protonic defects in the material. The differences in proton conduction along different crystallographic directions attributed to proton ordering in BIO are of a similar extent as those observed along different crystallographic directions in materials where proton ordering is not present but where protons find preferential conduction pathways through chain-like or layered structures.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b02497	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Strong Photoluminescence Enhancement of MoS2 through Defect Engineering
  and Oxygen Bonding"	Haiyan Nan	Zilu Wang, Wenhui Wang, Zheng Liang, Yan Lu, Qian Chen, Daowei He, Pingheng Tan, Feng Miao, Xinran Wang, Jinlan Wang, Zhenhua Ni	2014-05-17 00:37:53	We report on a strong photoluminescence (PL) enhancement of monolayer MoS2 through defect engineering and oxygen bonding. Micro- PL and Raman images clearly reveal that the PL enhancement occurs at cracks/defects formed during high temperature vacuum annealing. The PL enhancement at crack/defect sites could be as high as thousands of times after considering the laser spot size. The main reasons of such huge PL enhancement include: (1) the oxygen chemical adsorption induced heavy p doping and the conversion from trion to exciton; (2) the suppression of non-radiative recombination of excitons at defect sites as verified by low temperature PL measurements. First principle calculations reveal a strong binding energy of ~2.395 eV for oxygen molecule adsorbed on an S vacancy of MoS2. The chemical adsorbed oxygen also provides a much more effective charge transfer (0.997 electrons per O2) compared to physical adsorbed oxygen on ideal MoS2 surface. We also demonstrate that the defect engineering and oxygen bonding could be easily realized by oxygen plasma irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirms the formation of Mo-O bonding. Our results provide a new route for modulating the optical properties of two dimensional semiconductors. The strong and stable PL from defects sites of MoS2 may have promising applications in optoelectronic devices.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn500532f	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Azimuthal variations of gas-phase oxygen abundance in NGC 2997	I-Ting Ho	Sharon E. Meidt, Rolf-Peter Kudritzki, Brent A. Groves, Mark Seibert, Barry F. Madore, Eva Schinnerer, Jeffrey A. Rich, Chiaki Kobayashi, Lisa J. Kewley	2018-07-05 15:02:57	The azimuthal variation of the HII region oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies is a key observable for understanding how quickly oxygen produced by massive stars can be dispersed within the surrounding interstellar medium. Observational constraints on the prevalence and magnitude of such azimuthal variations remain rare in the literature. Here, we report the discovery of pronounced azimuthal variations of HII region oxygen abundance in NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy at approximately 11.3 Mpc. Using 3D spectroscopic data from the TYPHOON Program, we study the HII region oxygen abundance at a physical resolution of 125 pc. Individual HII regions or complexes are identified in the 3D optical data and their strong emission line fluxes measured to constrain their oxygen abundances. We find 0.06 dex azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance on top of a radial abundance gradient that is comparable to those seen in other star-forming disks. At a given radial distance, the oxygen abundances are highest in the spiral arms and lower in the inter-arm regions, similar to what has been reported in NGC 1365 using similar observations. We discuss whether the azimuthal variations could be recovered when the galaxy is observed at worse physical resolutions and lower signal-to-noise ratios.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833262	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Atomic-resolution study of oxygen vacancy ordering in
  $La_{0.5}$$Sr_{0.5}$Co$O_{3-δ}$ thin films on SrTi$O_{3}$ during
  in-situ cooling experiments"	Xue Rui	Robert Klie	2018-11-24 05:57:38	The presence of oxygen vacancy, as well as ordering of vacancies plays an important role in determining the electronic, ionic and thermal transport properties of many transition metal oxide materials. Controlling the concentration of oxygen vacancies as well as the structures or domains of ordered oxygen vacancies has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies. In epitaxial thin films, the concentration of oxygen vacancies as well as the type of ordering depends on the structure of the support as well as the lattice mismatch between the thin films and the support. The role of temperature induced structural phase transitions on the oxygen vacancy ordering has remained largely unexplored. Here, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with an in-situ cooling experiments to characterize the atomic/electronic structures of oxygen-deficient $La_{0.5}$$Sr_{0.5}$Co$O_{3-{\delta}}$ thin films grown on SrTi$O_{3}$ across the anti-ferrodistortive phase transition of SrTi$O_{3}$ at 105 K. We demonstrate that atomic-resolution imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) can be used to examine variations in the local density of states as a function of sample temperature and thus of the structure of the support.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1431927618000910	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Proof-of-concept thermoelectric oxygen sensor exploiting oxygen mobility
  of GdBaCo2O5+δ"	Soumya Biswas	Madhujith M K, Vinayak Kamble	2020-10-05 05:06:16	In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept oxygen sensor based on the thermoelectric principle using polycrystalline $GdBaCo_2O_{5+\delta}$ where 0.45<${\delta}$<0.55 (GDCO). The lattice oxygen in layered double perovskite oxides is highly susceptible to the ambient oxygen partial pressure. The as-synthesized GDCO sample processed in ambient conditions shows pure orthorhombic ($P_{mmm}$ space group) phase and a ${\delta}$-value close to 0.5 as confirmed from X-ray diffraction reitveld refinement. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows significant $Co^{3+}$ oxidation state in non-octahedral sites in addition to $Co^{3+}$ and $Co^{4+}$ in octahedral sites. The insulator-to-metal transition (MIT) is observed at nearly 340 K as seen in electrical resistivity and seebeck coefficient measurements. The seebeck coefficient shows a large change of about 10-13 $\mu$V/K with time constant of ~20 sec, at room temperature (300 K) when the gas ambience changes from 100% oxygen to 100% nitrogen and vice versa, under a constant temperature gradient of 1 K. The response in seebeck is found to be particularly large below MIT. The diffusion of oxygen into the lattice leading to hole doping shows a large change in carrier concentration resulting in a large change in the seebeck coefficient in insulating state. On the other hand, due to insignificant increase in already large carrier concentration in metallic state the change in seebeck is minimal. Nevertheless, below MIT the response is fairly reproducible within stoichiometry ${\delta}$ = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.05. This principle shall be of significant utility to design the oxygen sensors which work at room temperature or even cryogenic temperatures.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0027709	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Spatially resolved measurements of the solar photospheric oxygen
  abundance"	Melania Cubas Armas	Andrés Asensio Ramos, Héctor Socas-Navarro	2020-10-05 16:57:25	Aims. We report the results of a novel determination of the solar oxygen abundance using spatially resolved observations and inversions. We seek to derive the photospheric solar oxygen abundance with a method that is robust against uncertainties in the model atmosphere.   Methods. We use observations with spatial resolution obtained at the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) to derive the oxygen abundance at 40 different spatial positions in granules and intergranular lanes. We first obtain a model for each location by inverting the Fe I lines with the NICOLE inversion code. These models are then integrated into a hierarchical Bayesian model that is used to infer the most probable value for the oxygen abundance that is compatible with all the observations. The abundance is derived from the [O I] forbidden line at 6300 {\AA} taking into consideration all possible nuisance parameters that can affect the abundance.   Results. Our results show good agreement in the inferred oxygen abundance for all the pixels analyzed, demonstrating the robustness of the analysis against possible systematic errors in the model. We find a slightly higher oxygen abundance in granules than in intergranular lanes when treated separately (log(\epsilon_O) = 8.83 \pm 0.02 vs log(\epsilon_O) = 8.76 \pm 0.02), which is a difference of approximately 2-{\sigma}. This tension suggests that some systematic errors in the model or the radiative transfer still exist but are small. When taking all pixels together, we obtain an oxygen abundance of log(\epsilon_O)=8.80 \pm 0.03, which is compatible with both granules and lanes within 1-{\sigma}. The spread of results is due to both systematic and random errors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202037849	cs	arxiv					0.0	
3D Simulations of Oxygen Shell Burning with and without Magnetic Fields	Vishnu Varma	Bernhard Müller	2021-01-01 11:28:47	We present a first 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of convective oxygen and neon shell burning in a non-rotating $18\, M_\odot$ star shortly before core collapse to study the generation of magnetic fields in supernova progenitors. We also run a purely hydrodynamic control simulation to gauge the impact of the magnetic fields on the convective flow and on convective boundary mixing. After about 17 convective turnover times, the magnetic field is approaching saturation levels in the oxygen shell with an average field strength of $\mathord{\sim}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$, and does not reach kinetic equipartition. The field remains dominated by small to medium scales, and the dipole field strength at the base of the oxygen shell is only $10^{9}\, \mathrm{G}$. The angle-averaged diagonal components of the Maxwell stress tensor mirror those of the Reynolds stress tensor, but are about one order of magnitude smaller. The shear flow at the oxygen-neon shell interface creates relatively strong fields parallel to the convective boundary, which noticeably inhibit the turbulent entrainment of neon into the oxygen shell. The reduced ingestion of neon lowers the nuclear energy generation rate in the oxygen shell and thereby slightly slows down the convective flow. Aside from this indirect effect, we find that magnetic fields do not appreciably alter the flow inside the oxygen shell. We discuss the implications of our results for the subsequent core-collapse supernova and stress the need for longer simulations, resolution studies, and an investigation of non-ideal effects for a better understanding of magnetic fields in supernova progenitors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab883	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Deterministic influence of substrate-induced oxygen vacancy diffusion on
  $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ thin film growth"	Saikat Das	Tadakatsu Ohkubo, Shinya Kasai, Yusuke Kozuka	2021-01-26 05:04:07	In oxide epitaxy, the growth temperature and background oxygen partial pressure are considered as the most critical factors that control the phase stability of an oxide thin film. Here, we report an unusual case wherein diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the substrate overpowers the growth temperature and oxygen partial pressure to deterministically influence the phase stability of $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ thin film grown by the pulsed laser deposition technique. We show that when grown on an oxygen-deficient $SrTiO_{3}$ substrate, the $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ film exhibits a mixture of (001) and (100)/(010)-oriented domains alongside (001)-oriented impurity $WO_{3}$ phases. The (100)/(010)-oriented $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ phases form a self-organized 3D nanopillar-structure, yielding a very rough film surface morphology. Oxygen annealing of the substrate or using a few monolayer-thick $SrRuO_{3}$ as the blocking layer for oxygen vacancy diffusion enables growing high-quality single-crystalline $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ (001) thin film exhibiting an atomically smooth film surface with step-terrace structure. We propose that the large oxide-ion conductivity of $Bi_{2}WO_{6}$ facilitates diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the substrate during the film growth, accelerating the evaporation of volatile Bismuth (Bi), which hinders the epitaxial growth. Our work provides a general guideline for high-quality thin film growth of Aurivillius compounds and other oxide-ion conductors containing volatile elements.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.cgd.0c01428	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Towards real-time oxygen sensing: From nanomaterials to plasma	Vinitha Johny	KV Chinmaya, Muhammed Nihal CV, Varghese Kurian, G Mohan Rao, Moumita Ghosh, Siddharth Ghosh	2021-12-07 00:39:42	A significantly large scope is available for the scientific and engineering developments of high-throughput ultra-high sensitive oxygen sensors. We give a perspective of oxygen sensing for two physical states of matters - solid-state nanomaterials and plasma. From single-molecule experiments to material selection, we reviewed various aspects of sensing, such as capacitance, photophysics, electron mobility, response time, and a yearly progress. Towards miniaturisation, we have highlighted the benefit of lab-on-chip-based devices and showed exemplary measurements of fast real-time oxygen sensing. From the physical-chemistry perspective, plasma holds a strong potential in the application of oxygen sensing. We investigated the current state-of-the-art of electron density, temperature, and design issues of plasma systems. We also show a numerical aspects of low-cost approach towards developing plasma-based oxygen sensor from household candle flame. In this perspective, we give an opinion about a diverse range of scientific insight together, identifies the short comings, and opens the path for new physical-chemistry device developments of oxygen sensor along with providing a guideline for innovators in oxygen sensing.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03434v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Modelling the effect of vascular status on tumour evolution and outcome
  after thermal therapy"	Jesús J. Bosque	Gabriel F. Calvo, María Cruz Navarro	2022-01-10 13:24:10	Microscale oxygenation plays a prominent role in tumour progression. Spatiotemporal variability of oxygen distribution in the tumour microenvironment contributes to cellular heterogeneity and to the emergence of normoxic and hypoxic populations. Local levels of oxygen strongly affect the response of tumours to the administration of different therapeutic modalities and, more generally, to the phenomenon of resistance to treatments. Several interventions have been proposed to improve tumour oxygenation, being the elevation of the local temperature (hyperthermia) an important one. While other factors such as the metabolic activity have to be considered, the proficiency of the tumour vascular system is a key factor both for the tissue oxygenation and for its temperature maps. Consequently, the interplay of these factors has attracted considerable attention from the mathematical modelling perspective. Here we put forward a transport-based system of partial differential equations aimed at describing the dynamics of healthy and tumour cell subpopulations at the microscale in a region placed between two blood vessels. By using this model with diverse flow conditions, we analyse the oxygen and temperature profiles that arise in different scenarios of vascular status, both during free progression and under thermal therapy. We find that low oxygen levels are associated to elevations of temperature in locations preferentially populated by hypoxic cells, and hyperthermia-induced cell death, being strongly dependent on blood flow, would only appear under highly disrupted conditions of the local vasculature. This results in a noticeable effect of heat on hypoxic cells. Additionally, when pronounced cell death occurs, it is followed by a significant increase in the oxygen levels.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11584v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Preferred corrosion pathways for oxygen in Al2Ca-twin boundaries and
  dislocations"	Nicolas J. Peter	Daniela Zander, Xumeng Cao, Chunhua Tian, Siyuan Zhang, Kui Du, Christina Scheu, Gerhard Dehm	2022-08-01 19:41:30	With an ongoing discussion on the oxygen diffusion along crystal defects remaining, it is difficult to study this phenomenon in Al containing intermetallic materials due to its rapid and passivating oxide formation. We report here the observation of enhanced oxygen diffusion along crystal defects, i.e. dislocations and twin boundaries, in the C15 Al 2 Ca Laves phase and how the presence of oxygen induces structural changes at these defects. Three main phases were identified and characterized structurally by aberration-corrected, atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, analytically by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Unlike the C15 bulk phase, the twin boundary and dislocation transformed into a few nanometer wide amorphous phase, which depletes in Al and Ca but is highly enriched in oxygen. The dislocation even shows coexistence of the amorphous phase with a simple Al-rich A1 fcc phase. This A1 phase only depletes in Ca, not in Al (Al remains at bulk concentration), and is also enriched in oxygen. The Al-rich A1 phase is coherent with the C15 matrix. Electron energy loss spectroscopy revealed the amorphous phase to be Al 2 O 3 . We thereby show as one of the first studies that oxygen diffusion along crystal defects, especially also at the twin boundary can induce the formation of an amorphous oxide along themselves. The identification of oxygen-induced transformation at strained defects has to be considered when the material is exposed to air during plastic deformation at elevated temperatures.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01116v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Chemical abundances in the dwarf galaxy NGC 4163 based on the nebular
  and auroral emission lines"	I. A. Zinchenko	L. S. Pilyugin	2022-11-28 19:00:46	We constructed an oxygen abundance map and N/O ratio map of the unusually low excitation dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 4163 based on publicly available spectroscopy obtained by the MaNGA survey. We detected auroral emission line [OII]$\lambda\lambda$7320,7330 which allows us to measure chemical abundance by direct T$_e$ method. We found that the scatter of the oxygen abundance derived by the strong line method is large. The oxygen abundances 12 + log(O/H) derived by strong line method vary from ~7.3 to ~7.8 with a mean value of ~7.55. The oxygen abundances derived in two apertures of 2 arcseconds by the direct T$_e$ method using our measurements of the O$^+$ auroral line is about 7.8 dex. The nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio log(N/O) of about -1.5 is typical value for a low metallicity galaxy, maybe slightly shifted towards higher N/O ratios with respect to the N/O values in the HII regions in nearby galaxies. An unusual negative trend between log(N/O) and oxygen abundance is detected. NGC 4163 is a gas-poor galaxy with a neutral atomic gas mass fraction of around 0.25. The oxygen abundance in the galaxy is only around 0.1 of the oxygen abundance potentially attainable in a galaxy with such a gas mass fraction. The low metallicity coupled with the low gas mass fraction implies that either the metallicity of the interstellar medium of the galaxy was reduced by pristine gas infall in the recent epoch or the evolution of this galaxy was accompanied by strong galactic winds.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asna.20220048	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The volume of healthy red blood cells maximizes oxygen transport	Lucas Amoudruz	Athena Economides, Petros Koumoutsakos	2023-04-28 21:24:42	Red blood cells (RBCs) play a crucial role in oxygen transport in living organisms as the vast majority of oxygen in the blood is bound to the hemoglobin molecules in their cytosol. Healthy RBCs have a biconcave shape and a flexible membrane enabling them to undergo substantial reversible elastic deformation as they traverse narrow capillaries during microcirculation. This RBC deformability is critical for efficient circulation while the unique biconcave shape of healthy RBCs is attributed to their specific volume, which affects the amount of oxygen they can carry. However, despite extensive research, the underlying mechanism that determines the optimal RBC volume remains unknown. This paper examines the impact of RBC volume on the efficiency of oxygen transport from a fluid dynamics standpoint. Our investigation reveals that RBCs with volumes similar to those observed in vivo demonstrate superior oxygen transport efficiency in circular tubes similar to arterioles, which represent areas of the circulatory system with the highest flow resistance. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms that impair oxygen transport when the RBC volume deviates from the optimal value. While healthy RBCs produce a maximum cell-free layer thickness that affects flow dissipation, smaller RBC volumes result in greater deformations and thus dissipate more energy. Strikingly, the flow resistance is minimized at the reduced volume of healthy RBCs. Our study highlights that the volume of healthy RBCs maximizes oxygen transport efficiency and may offer insight into developing targeted treatments for circulatory disorders.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02197v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Deep Search For Molecular Oxygen in TW Hya	Becky J. Williams	L. Ilsedore Cleeves, Christian Eistrup, Jon P. Ramsey	2023-09-08 18:00:01	The dominant form of oxygen in cold molecular clouds is gas-phase carbon monoxide (CO) and ice-phase water (H$_2$O). Yet, in planet-forming disks around young stars, gas-phase CO and H$_2$O are less abundant relative to their ISM values, and no other major oxygen-carrying molecules have been detected. Some astrochemical models predict that gas-phase molecular oxygen (O$_2$) should be a major carrier of volatile oxygen in disks. We report a deep search for emission from the isotopologue $^{16}$O$^{18}$O ($N_J=2_1-0_1$ line at 233.946 GHz) in the nearby protoplanetary disk around TW Hya. We used imaging techniques and matched filtering to search for weak emission but do not detect $^{16}$O$^{18}$O. Based on our results, we calculate upper limits on the gas-phase O$_2$ abundance in TW Hya of $(6.4-70)\times10^{-7}$ relative to H, which is $2-3$ orders of magnitude below solar oxygen abundance. We conclude that gas-phase O$_2$ is not a major oxygen-carrier in TW Hya. Two other potential oxygen-carrying molecules, SO and SO$_2$, were covered in our observations, which we also do not detect. Additionally, we report a serendipitous detection of the C$^{15}$N $N_J = 2_{5/2}-1_{3/2}$ hyperfine transitions, $F = 3 - 2$ and $F = 2 - 1$, at 219.9 GHz, which we found via matched filtering and confirm through imaging.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04521v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A two-timescale model of plankton-oxygen dynamics predicts formation of
  Oxygen Minimum Zones and global anoxia"	Pranali Roy Chowdhury	Malay Banerjee, Sergei Petrovskii	2023-09-27 07:32:39	"Decline of the dissolved oxygen in the ocean is a growing concern, as it may eventually lead to global anoxia, an elevated mortality of marine fauna and even a mass extinction. Deoxygenation of the ocean often results in the formation of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ): large domains where the abundance of oxygen is much lower than that in the surrounding ocean environment. Factors and processes resulting in the OMZ formation remain controversial. We consider a conceptual model of coupled plankton-oxygen dynamics that, apart from the plankton growth and the oxygen production by phytoplankton, also accounts for the difference in the timescales for phyto and zooplankton (making it a ""slow-fast system"") and for the implicit effect of upper trophic levels. The model is investigated using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations. We show that the system does not allow for persistent relaxation oscillations; instead, the blowup of the canard cycle results in plankton extinction and oxygen depletion. For the spatially explicit model, an initial non-uniform perturbation can lead to the formation of an OMZ, which then grows in size and spreads over space. For a sufficiently large timescale separation, the spread of the OMZ can result in global anoxia."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15447v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Oxygen abundances in dwarf irregular galaxies and the metallicity -
  luminosity relationship"	L. S. Pilyugin	Aucun	2001-05-21 11:50:02	The low-luminosity dwarf irregular galaxies are considered. The oxygen abundances in HII regions of dwarf irregular galaxies were recalculated from published spectra through the recently suggested P - method. It has been found that the metallicity of low-luminosity dwarf irregular galaxies, with a few exceptions, correlates well with galaxy luminosity. The dispersion of oxygen abundances around the metallicity - luminosity relationship increases with decreasing of galaxy luminosity, as was found by Richer and McCall (1995). No relationship between the oxygen abundance and the absolute magnitude in the blue band for irregular galaxies obtained by Hidalgo-Gamez and Olofsson (1998) can be explained by the large uncertainties in the oxygen abundances derived through the Te - method, that in turn can be explained by the large uncertainties in the measurements of the strengths of the weak oxygen line [OIII]4363 used in the Te - method.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20010732	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On the relationship between auroral and nebular oxygen line intensities
  in spectra of HII regions"	L. S. Pilyugin	Aucun	2005-04-18 11:10:20	We investigate relationships between observed auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in spectra of HII regions. We find a relation that is metallicity-dependent at low metallicities, but becomes independent of metallicity (within the uncertainties of the available data) above 12+logO/H ~ 8.25, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondance (the ff - relation) between auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in spectra of high-metallicity HII regions. The ff - relation allows one to estimate the flux in the auroral line from strong oxygen line measurements. This solves the problem of the electron temperature (and, consequently, abundance) determination in high-metallicity HII regions. The ff - relation confirms the basic idea of the empirical method, proposed by Pagel et al. (1979) a qurter of a century ago, that the oxygen abundance in HII region can be estimated from the strong oxygen lines measurements only.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:200500108	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Argon annealing of the oxygen-isotope exchanged manganite
  La_{0.8}Ca_{0.2}MnO_{3+y}"	G. M. Zhao	K. Conder, H. Keller, K. A. Muller	2000-02-25 18:30:40	We have resolved a controversial issue concerning the oxygen-isotope shift of the ferromagnetic transition temperature T_{C} in the manganite La_{0.8}Ca_{0.2}MnO_{3+y}. We show that the giant oxygen-isotope shift of T_C observed in the normal oxygen-isotope exchanged samples is indeed intrinsic, while a much smaller shift observed in the argon annealed samples is an artifact. The argon annealing causes the 18O sample to partially exchange back to the 16O isotope due to a small 16O contamination in the Ar gas. Such a contamination is commonly caused by the oxygen outgas that is trapped in the tubes, connectors and valves. The present results thus umambiguously demonstrate that the observed large oxygen isotope effect is an intrinsic property of manganites, and places an important constraint on the basic physics of these materials.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.62.5334	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Oxygen impurities in NiAl: Relaxation effects	David Djajaputra	Bernard R. Cooper	2001-07-18 00:07:48	We have used a full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method to calculate the effects of oxygen impurities on the electronic structure of NiAl. Using the supercell method with a 16-atom supercell we have investigated the cases where an oxygen atom is substitutionally placed at either a nickel or an aluminum site. Full relaxation of the atoms within the supercell was allowed. We found that oxygen prefers to occupy a nickel site over an aluminum site with a site selection energy of 138 mRy (21,370 K). An oxygen atom placed at an aluminum site is found to cause a substantial relaxation of its nickel neighbors away from it. In contrast, this steric repulsion is hardly present when the oxygen atom occupies the nickel site and is surrounded by aluminum neighbors. We comment on the possible relation of this effect to the pesting degradation phenomenon (essentially spontaneous disintegration in air) in nickel aluminides.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.64.085121	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Stability of sub-surface oxygen at Rh(111)	M. Veronica Ganduglia-Pirovano	Karsten Reuter, Matthias Scheffler	2002-05-13 11:07:20	Using density-functional theory (DFT) we investigate the incorporation of oxygen directly below the Rh(111) surface. We show that oxygen incorporation will only commence after nearly completion of a dense O adlayer (\theta_tot = 1.0 monolayer) with O in the fcc on-surface sites. The experimentally suggested octahedral sub-surface site occupancy, inducing a site-switch of the on-surface species from fcc to hcp sites, is indeed found to be a rather low energy structure. Our results indicate that at even higher coverages oxygen incorporation is followed by oxygen agglomeration in two-dimensional sub-surface islands directly below the first metal layer. Inside these islands, the metastable hcp/octahedral (on-surface/sub-surface) site combination will undergo a barrierless displacement, introducing a stacking fault of the first metal layer with respect to the underlying substrate and leading to a stable fcc/tetrahedral site occupation. We suggest that these elementary steps, namely, oxygen incorporation, aggregation into sub-surface islands and destabilization of the metal surface may be more general and precede the formation of a surface oxide at close-packed late transition metal surfaces.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.65.245426	cs	arxiv					0.0

Buhrman	2005-01-14 23:39:07	We present X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data which show that the chemisorbed oxygen previously observed to be on the surface of thin AlOx layers formed by room temperature thermal oxidation is bound by oxygen vacancies in the oxide. Increasing the electric field across the oxide, either by over-coating with a metallic electrode, or by electron bombardment, drives this surface chemisorbed oxygen into the vacancy sites. Due to the low bonding energies of these oxygen sites, subsequent oxygen exposures draw these ions back to the surface, reforming chemisorbed O$_2^-$. Al/AlOx/Al tunnel junctions incorporating electron bombarded AlOx barriers show a significant reduction in the low frequency junction resistance noise level at 4.2 K.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.161401	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Chain-oxygen ordering in twin-free YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals driven by
  20 keV electron irradiation"	H. W. Seo	Q. Y. Chen, M. N. Iliev, N. Kolev, U. Welp, C. Wang, Tom H. Johansen, Wei-Kan Chu	2005-03-09 01:07:17	We have examined the effects of 20 keV electron irradiation on [-Cu(1)-O(1)-]n chain oxygen arrangements in oxygen deficient but otherwise twin-free YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals. Comparison of polarized Raman spectra of non-irradiated and irradiated areas provides evidence that electron bombardments instigate the collective hopping of oxygen atoms either from an interstitial at O(5) site to a vacant O(1) chain site or by reshuffling the chain segments to extend the average length of chains without changing the overall oxygen content. This oxygen ordering effect, while counter-intuitive, is analogous to that found in the photoexcitation induced ordering in which temporal charge imbalance from electron-hole pair creation by inelastic scattering of incident electrons causes a local lattice distortion which brings on the atomic rearrangements.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.72.052501	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The mechanism of the decrease of barriers for oxygen ionic conductivity
  in nanocrystalline ceramics"	M. D. Glinchuk	P. I. Bykov, B. Hilczer	2005-07-06 12:45:52	We calculated the influence of surface tension on the barriers of oxygen ionic conductivity in nanograin ceramics. Activation energy of oxygen ions diffusion via oxygen vacancies which were considered as the dilatational centers was calculated. This energy was shown to decrease with nanoparticle sizes decreasing. The distribution function of activation energy was derived on the basis of distribution of nanoparticle sizes. We obtained an analytical expressions of ionic conductivity dependence on the temperature and nanograin sizes. These formulas fitted pretty good the observed earlier behaviour of oxygen conductivity in nanograin ceramics of ZrO2:16% Y observed earlier. Therefore the consideration we carried out had shown that the surface tension in nanoparticles is physical mechanism responsible for the essential enhancement of the oxygen ionic conductivity observed in nanograin samples, the main contribution to the conductivity being related to the region in vicinity of the particle surface.	http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0507140v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The Origin of the Decoupling of Oxygen and Silicon Dynamics in Liquid
  Silica as Expressed by its Potential Energy Landscape"	A. Saksaengwijit	A. Heuer	2006-09-27 09:16:56	The oxygen and silicon dynamics in silica is compared via computer simulations. In agreement with experimental data and previous simulations a decoupling of oxygen and silicon dynamics is observed upon cooling. The origin of this decoupling is studied in the framework of the potential energy landscape. From analysis of the transition features between neighboring superstructures of minima, denoted metabasins, the differences between the oxygen and the silicon dynamics can be quantified. The decoupling can be explicitly related to the presence of generalized rotational processes, giving rise to oxygen but not to silicon displacement. Closer analysis of these processes yields important insight into the nature of the potential energy landscape of silica. The physical picture of relaxation processes in silica, obtained in previous work for the oxygen dynamics, is consistent with the decoupling effects, elucidated here.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.051502	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"The contribution of Oxygen-Neon white dwarfs to the MACHO content of the
  Galactic Halo"	J. Camacho	S. Torres, J. Isern, L. G. Althaus, E. Garcia-Berro	2007-06-18 10:37:28	The interpretation of microlensing results towards the Large   Magellanic Cloud (LMC) still remains controversial. White dwarfs have been proposed to explain these results and, hence, to contribute significantly to the mass budget of our Galaxy. However, several constraints on the role played by regular carbon-oxygen white dwarfs exist. Massivewhite dwarfs are thought to be made of a mixture of oxygen and neon. Correspondingly, their cooling rate is larger than those of typical carbon-oxygen white dwarfs and they fade to invisibility in short timescales. Consequently, they constitute a good candidate for explaining the microlensing results. Here, we examine in detail this hypothesis by using the most recent and up-to-date cooling tracks for massive white dwarfs and a Monte Carlo simulator which takes into account the most relevant Galactic inputs. We find that oxygen-neon white dwarfs cannot account for a substantial fraction of the microlensing depth towards the LMC, independently of the adopted initial mass function, although some microlensing events could be due to oxygen--neon white dwarfs. The white dwarf population contributes at most a 5% to the mass of the Galactic halo.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20077714	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Formation and properties of metal-oxygen atomic chains	W. H. A. Thijssen	M. Strange, J. M. J. aan de Brugh, J. M. van Ruitenbeek	2007-09-17 20:19:28	Suspended chains consisting of single noble metal and oxygen atoms have been formed. We provide evidence that oxygen can react with and be incorporated into metallic one-dimensional atomic chains. Oxygen incorporation reinforces the linear bonds in the chain, which facilitates the creation of longer atomic chains. The mechanical and electrical properties of these diatomic chains have been investigated by determining local vibration modes of the chain and by measuring the dependence of the average chain-conductance on the length of the chain. Additionally, we have performed calculations that give insight in the physical mechanism of the oxygen-induced strengthening of the linear bonds and the conductance of the metal-oxygen chains.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/10/3/033005	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Effect of stoichiometry on oxygen incorporation in MgB2 thin films	R K Singh	Y Shen, R Gandikota, J M Rowell, N Newman	2007-09-25 18:52:38	The amount of oxygen incorporated into MgB2 thin films upon exposure to atmospheric gasses is found to depend strongly on the material's stoichiometry. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy was used to monitor changes in oxygen incorporation resulting from exposure to: (a) ambient atmosphere, (b) humid atmospheres, (c) anneals in air and (d) anneals in oxygen. The study investigated thin-film samples with compositions that were systematically varied from Mg0.9B2 to Mg1.1B2. A significant surface oxygen contamination was observed in all of these films. The oxygen content in the bulk of the film, on the other hand, increased significantly only in Mg rich films and in films exposed to humid atmospheres.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-2048/21/01/015018	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Chemical Power for Microscopic Robots in Capillaries	Tad Hogg	Robert A. Freitas Jr	2009-06-26 23:54:08	The power available to microscopic robots (nanorobots) that oxidize bloodstream glucose while aggregated in circumferential rings on capillary walls is evaluated with a numerical model using axial symmetry and time-averaged release of oxygen from passing red blood cells. Robots about one micron in size can produce up to several tens of picowatts, in steady-state, if they fully use oxygen reaching their surface from the blood plasma. Robots with pumps and tanks for onboard oxygen storage could collect oxygen to support burst power demands two to three orders of magnitude larger. We evaluate effects of oxygen depletion and local heating on surrounding tissue. These results give the power constraints when robots rely entirely on ambient available oxygen and identify aspects of the robot design significantly affecting available power. More generally, our numerical model provides an approach to evaluating robot design choices for nanomedicine treatments in and near capillaries.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nano.2009.10.002	cs	arxiv					0.0

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy worked	LobsterAgile415	Aucun	2023-11-29 02:32:09	I had a bad day today wirh long Covid, breathless, fatigue, moodiness, brain fog, swelling and had muscle cramps and I tried a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.  I felt the difference after 15 minutes and didn't want to get out of it. Emerging my mood was high, muscle cramps were mostly gone and at the end i had no brain fog or fatigue. It didn't even feel like my body, my body felt like it did when I was 15 years old with that energy.  I came home and climbed into bed to warm up my feet (that thing is cold) and ended up having a long nap. I'm fatigued, which is apparently a side effect but it's not the normal long covid fatigue which feels like drowning to me. My body feels unnaturally without tension, and stress and I feel like I can breath normally without the feeling a rock is sitting on my chest. This fatigue feels healthy like my body is tired from repairing itself.   I can't afford it regularly but I would live inside it if I could. Even if it's the place where I can sleep and think clearly. I thought I'd recommend it. I wish I found it sooner.	https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/186efge/hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy_worked/		reddit	186efge	LongCovid	38.0	38.0	22.0

However, i’ve been just buying o2 tanks from my local CPAP store which is pretty inconvenient and leaves me out of luck if i run out of tanks and cant get more in time. I’ve put off buying an oxygen concentrator machine but I know it will be well worth it so I need some recommendations.

I just finished Diary of an Oxygen Thief	Scooter_McLefty	Aucun	2022-02-08 11:39:23	I want to start by saying I totally understand why people dislike this book, it isn’t for everyone. For those who never heard of it, it’s basically a character study on someone who emotionally abuses women that he casually dates. The first few pages really grip you in with a strong hook but falters after the narrator describes his 5th or 6th relationship. Things pick back up when he meets a woman he genuinely cares about but is very cold / cruel to him. Throughout though, he proves himself to be an unreliable narrator and the books has its humorous moments.  But this book was hyped up to me as something extremely disturbed and not for the faint of heart. However, I didn’t feel as if the book was as depraved as I had been led to believe. This might be because I’ve read American Psycho but who knows. The main character is very clearly a piece of shit though. Imagine Dennis Reynolds, Don Draper, and Holden Caulfield all mixed together. Anyway if you enjoy dark looks at individuals that are constantly sarcastic, you might enjoy this book.	https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sni6o2/i_just_finished_diary_of_an_oxygen_thief/		reddit	sni6o2	books	45.0	45.0	11.0

The Oxygen Breathers	jpitha	Aucun	2023-06-29 19:56:29	"It was always an event when the Humans visited.      They'd arrive in their sleek, smooth, thick ships, completely at odds with the other ships of the Coalition. Human ships always looked like they were grown rather than built. People would whisper how the Humans made their ships as tough as they were. How human ships could go atmospheric and land on the ground.      It was nonsense of course, no ship - human or otherwise - could do that. Kre'kk figured that the Humans spread the rumor themselves.      After they'd arrive, they would come out of the docking umbilical in their small, polished suits. They were a rare class of sapient indeed.      The Oxygen Breathers.      Most 'civilized' people in the Coalition came from worlds with Manganese Sulfur atmospheres. The humans with their oxidizer for a breathing gas are seen as brash, reckless folks who make decisions without proper consideration. Given the reactive nature of their atmosphere, it's practically a given that they too are more reactive in their choices.      Kre'kk stands at attention at the end of the umbilical ready to welcome the humans for their - hopefully - short visit. They come from a high gravity world with a single massive moon - fully a quarter of the size of their own planet itself - so their environmental defaults are... somewhat extreme compared to the rest of the Coalition.      The humans keep to themselves.       As they approached, they stopped one half unit away from Kre'kk and stop. He looked down at them - they were about half his height - and he made the Universal Gesture of welcome. The humans reciprocate and Kre'kk begins.      ""Welcome to Coalition Orbital 43559 - known to the Lemilar as 'Habilamen.' I am Administrator Kre'kk and I welcome you as equals for you visit.""      The human at the head of the group is wearing a slightly different suit. Still polished and reflective, but where the rest of the humans are wearing suits of pitch black, darker than interstellar space, this one's is a deep vermillion red. Kre'kk is drawn to the color. It's so rich! It almost looks wet.   When she begins to speak, an icon of a human face is projected onto the smooth polished surface of the helmet. It seems that the humans have taken some care to make themselves look less anonymous and frightening in their environmental suits. ""Thank you for the greeting, Administrator Kre'kk. I am Captain Margaret Kellerman and this is my crew."" She gestures behind her. ""We plan on staying only for three cycles demi in order to take on a load of Ribanium and trade with any interested parties. I have a manifest of what we have available to trade."" She gestures on her arm, and the file appears on Kre'kk's pad.      Kre'kk is taken aback at her voice. It's so clear. She seems to be speaking through a translator, but it is getting the nuance and overtones of the Lemilar Trade Language perfectly. She could have a career as an entertainer or storyteller easily if she was a difference species. ""Uh, thank you Captain, I have received your file and will distribute it. Please make use of our facilities during your stay.""      Captain Kellerman's helmet flashed a icon of a face, smiling - without their teeth - broadly. ""Thank you Administrator Kre'kk, we shall.""      For two cycles, Kre'kk held out hope that the human's visit would be without incident. They came in quietly, did some minor trading, loaded their Ribanium and spent a reasonable amount of money on entertainment and refreshments - suitable for their systems - while on board. Kre'kk felt they were trying very hard to be model visitors. Apparently they knew humans had a reputation in the Coalition for being... rowdy.       On the last demi cycle before the Humans were scheduled to depart a group of Felimen came over, angry. They had spent the entire two cycles previous loudly complaining that the humans shouldn't be here, and that they had captured Felimen colonies long ago and had begun the process of 'poisoning them' to be more suitable to them. The Human authorities maintain - and have the receipts to prove - that they purchased the planets legally from the Felimen, and never attempted to hide their goals of colonization. Regardless, a long, bloody war had followed and the humans had pushed the Felimen to capitulate and were currently engaged in a Cold War with each other.      Kre'kk was alerted as soon as the shouts started. The Felimen seemed to come to the humans wanting to cause trouble. For their part, the humans tried their best to talk the Felimen down. Their helmet icons were looking sad and quiet and they gestured in ways to try and reduce tension. The Felimen were having none of it though.       As Kre'kk undulated over to try and calm them, one of the Felimen in the back had wheeled out a battle rifle. Kre'kk had no idea how they had snuck it in, but it was completely banned on the Orbital and was cause for immediate expulsion. Before he could sound the alarm and get the Orbital authorities to come, they fired at the group of humans.       It proved to be a fatal error in judgement.      Faster than Kre'kk could follow and only confirmed by viewing the security footage after the fact three of the humans brought massive slug throwers to bear. The Coalition sapient races find chemical powered metal slug throwers to be too heavy to be hand weapons. When they are used, they're tripod or vehicle mounted. The humans can pick them up and swing them around like they weigh nothing.       The noise of the slug throwers in the hall was deafening. Kre'kk wondered how the humans could take the noise without being injured, but he assumed they must have some kind of noise cancelling built into their environmental suits.       They fired for only one millicycle but it was more than enough. All of the Felimen were dead, with the ones in the front unrecognizable. The silence in the hall after they finished firing was deafening. It felt like an eternity after they had stopped before the station alarms sounded.      Kre'kk walked over to the humans. They were checking either others suits and cleaning up the small gold colored pieces of metal that come flying out of their throwers when they fire. ""Brass"" is what they call it. Kre'kk gestured an apology. ""I'm sorry, but you're going to have to leave now.""       Captain Kellerman's icon showed pure fury. Her gauntlet covered hand pointed at him accusingly. ""You're going to take their side, Administrator? You were here, you *saw* them. They shot first!""      Kre'kk slid back one half unit unconsciously. ""Be that as it may, you responded with disproportional force to their attack. It was uncalled for.""      Captain Kellerman sputtered, her melodic voice taking on frightening undertones as the translator worked overtime to relay her fury to Kre'kk. ""Uncalled for!? Administrator Kre'kk with all due respect you are *out of line*. You know about the war I assume, but do you know what they did to our colonies? They dropped nanobombs on our legally purchased colonies. They weren't trying to take back land, they were trying to obliterate us. I was there, I saw it with my own eyes.""      Kre'kk was taken aback. This was not part of the standard narrative about the war. ""I did not know that no, the Felimen-""      ""The Felimen tell their own version of the war in order to garner support and sympathy against 'the aggressor human' I'm sure."" Captain Kellerman sounded bitter in the translated voice. ""Kre'kk. Your people border the Felimen opposite us do you not?""      ""Yes, our territory borders theirs but-""      ""And have you by any chance heard of some border worlds coming under some kind of unknown trouble? Maybe a strange illness, or unusually strong weather on the worlds?""      Kre'kk's frill rippled worriedly and he said nothing. He had heard about things like that.      Captain Kellerman cleared her helmet. Suddenly, Kre'kk saw her clearly. Small, with bilateral symmetry, close set binocular eyes and a small mouth, this was the first time Kre'kk saw a human as they are, not as their icons show them. They are predators. They are hunters.      They are terrifying.      Kre'kk unconsciously made a gesture of fear and slid back another half unit. Captain Kellerman's face contorted into a snarl. ""Know this Kre'kk. It's only a matter of time before they do to you what they attempted - and failed - to do to us. Think hard about who your friends are and who in the Coalition you can come to for help when they start dropping nanobombs on your worlds."" Just as suddenly as it had cleared, her helmet darkened again, and the cartoon icon of her face returned. It felt like a mockery to Kre'kk now.      The humans picked up the rest of their debris and freed their weapons. Faster than Kre'kk could ripple, they were all carrying slug throwers. ""We're leaving Administrator Kre'kk. If any Felimen even come within 5 units of us-"" The people behind her cycled a round into their rifles for emphasis ""-we will take it as a provocation and will respond with 'disproportionate' force.""      ""Y-yes Captain. I will relay this information.""      ""Oh and Administrator Kre'kk? Your Station will be added to the list of Orbitals where humans will not go. We will do no trading, sell no wares, and offer no defense. You and yours will do well to consider your stand vis a vis the Felimen.""      Without another word, the group of humans turned and marched towards their ship. Shaking, Kre'kk signaled that they were not to be interrupted and made sure their warning about Felimen was relayed.      After they left and the mess was cleaned up, Kre'kk sat in his quarters and stared out the window at the planet below a long time. One of his creche mates was living on a newly founded colony bordering Felimen space. He began composing a message to beam to her asking if she had any plans about moving back."	https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/14meq8i/the_oxygen_breathers/		reddit	14meq8i	HFY	1813.0	1813.0	104.0	OC

Garen should get a resource system: Oxygen	Basket_of_Depl0rblz	Aucun	2020-05-03 05:19:58	Garen constantly runs around, spins in heavy armor, throws swords on other people’s heads and ignores enemy slows - all while screaming “CHOOOORGE!” and “FOR THE KONG!”.   Maybe he can somehow do this without the help of mana, ~~that fucking anti-wizard racist,~~ but you can’t tell me that this bad Death Lotus imitator has endless lung capacity.   So, here my proposal: Garen has a Heat-like resource bar with **100 oxygen units**. Every time he cast a spell or triggers a quote, some of the oxygen is drained. If the oxygen drops to or below 0, he hyperventilates for 6 seconds, becoming disarmed, slowed and having his armor and MR set to 0.   Garen can refresh his oxygen bar immediately by standing still (out of combat) for 4 seconds. If he hyperventilates, all oxygen is restored after the 6 second “punishment” period.   Players can reduce Garen’s resource consumption by casting spells less randomly, moving away from combat frequently (synergizing with his passive, btw) or turning off unit speech in the option menu.   As a bonus, an allied Janna can cast her W on Garen, restoring 20/21.25/22.5/23.75/25 oxygen + ((20 - 35%, based on level) + 2% AP) of his missing oxygen. However, pressing CTRL+1 within 1000 units of him causes immediate hyperventilation, so take care.   Thanks for letting me waste your time with this semi-serious idea. Maybe this would even accidentally make Garen more balanced. But I’m already happy if he will become less of a ferocious screamer. The only more annoying things are Yasuo, Olaf and God King Darius’ W (wuuuuuuh!...).   I will now listen to some scientific recordings of Kai’sa’s E, please excuse me for 20 minutes...  - - - -  **Next week:** New resource system for Katarina - **Daggers**!

[Update to my “blood oxygen is below 50” post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/s/FhNAQWHsBb)  **June 25, 2023**   Long-winded update for anyone who cares / my experience failing to summit Kilimanjaro.    As a bit of background, yesterday was the end of my adventures on Mt Kilimanjaro. Unfortunately on the summit attempt I ran into a brutal bout of altitude sickness, and came short of the summit with less than an hour of hiking left. Thankfully, I managed to get out without serious damage due to the incredible guides.   Like most hikers, I started for the summit from Barafu Camp (4,600m) at around midnight. From the get-go, I’m realising something’s not quite right with my fitness. I’m wheezing just from doing light walking at camp, and have a splitting headache and nausea that won’t go away. Anyway, we start the climb and around 5,200 I’m noticing I’m getting seriously winded, and my headache has evolved from uncomfortable to “why is there a tyre iron in my eye” painful.   I try to trudge though, but metres from Stella Point (5,700m) my body just shuts down, I’ve been gasping for air for the last half hour, but suddenly I just can’t fill my lungs at all. My legs turn to jelly beneath me, the headache turns blinding and I just collapse, desperate for air. My guide tries to help me up, but I’m a puddle at this point and just keep gasping at him for oxygen. I genuinely thought I was going to die, I couldn’t get a breath in.   We manage to find a tank from Stella Point, and it gives me a brief 5 minutes of relief that lets me regain my legs. My guide sprint/drags me down the mountain to a lower point. There we do the blood oxygen reading and it hits 49%. This same pulse oximeter has been giving me 85-90% consistently during the daily check-ins for the last week (apart from a 76% after an acclimatisation hike where we hit 4,600 before descending to below 4,000), so I tend to trust it and get intensely freaked out at the 49%.   My guide calls a medical chopper (which never ends up arriving) and I try to use a cell signal to find out information on what I can do as a means to stop the impacts of low blood ox (or at least calibrate my anxiety level appropriately). Being Tanzania’s 3G internet, none of the pages load on my phone, but reddit started up perfectly, so I decided to turn to this community for advice / emotional support. I of course got only detailed, compassionate responses, that reminded me that asking medical advice from strangers is a very sensible thing to do.   (No seriously, thank you to everyone to provided advice, it helped me get the help I needed once I got to the hospital).   Anyway, after waiting an hour for a chopper that never came, we ended up hiking for four hours to get to a road, and managed to get back to Moshi where my breathing returned to normal after a few hours. Still a bit crook, but no signs of permanent damage. So while there may have been a misread with my blood oxygen as a lot of people thought, I truly was in a bad state, and the oximeter my guide used was the one the same exact model the hospital used. I don’t know if I was truly below 50%, but I’ve never felt worse in my life.   So for anyone travelling to Kilimanjaro, enjoy a ewonderful experience, but as I learned, you can’t tough out altitude sickness, if you’re getting the signs, turn back before your body shuts down. Also, the two things you should never rely on in an emergency, emergency services in Tanzania and reddit.   **TL;DR:** Got slammed with altitude sickness on Kili, asked for help on reddit and was fairly mocked for using it as emergency help, but managed to get down safely.   **RELEVANT COMMENTS**   **ELI-PGY5**   >Hey mate, MD guy here who posted on the last thread.   >Glad to hear you pulled through OK.   >Altitude sickness sucks, and Kili is a pretty easy place to get it because it’s like a giant ramp straight up to the sky.   >Sorry that so many people here decided to mock you in the middle of a medical emergency, I thought a lot of the posts were unfortunate.   >Cheers!   **OOP**   >>Cheers mate, I really appreciated your comment on the last post. When you’re sick in a foreign place, decent advice like yours feels fantastic.   *   **phidauex**   >Thanks for the update, I was one of the slightly skeptical, but trying to be helpful posters.   >I’m very glad you are back safe, that makes the trip a success no matter what anyone says.   >Thanks for posting more about your situation, hard to put yourself out there but it will help others learn and that is why we are here.   >Good luck to you and I hope this doesn’t keep you out of the mountains forever, there is a whole world to explore in your back yard and you can now do so from the position of someone who has been there and seen how tough and complex it can get.   **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**	https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/185o3wm/my_blood_oxygen_is_below_50_unsure_what_to_do/		reddit	185o3wm	BestofRedditorUpdates	1810.0	1810.0	205.0	CONCLUDED

Sealing things up creates microaerobic/anaerobic conditions that favor the production of barfy stinky-feet short chain acids by bacteria. So, it's often a good idea to leave things open a crack to let some oxygen in. (Also, if you aren't running your dishwasher right after loading it, sponge off the water on the door before closing it  -- reducing the amount of water present also helps keep growth & odors down.)	https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/13zscq0/ysk_bacteria_are_stinkiest_when_they_dont_have/		reddit	13zscq0	YouShouldKnow	3149.0	3149.0	185.0	Home & Garden

I understand that breaking down lignin was difficult and it became coal but coal is mostly carbon.

Oxygen SR3 really is not pinnacle weapon worthy	Chumanchu	Aucun	2019-07-01 15:48:23	As someone who has Oxygen SR3, I can tell you from experience that it really is not anything special. Oxygen gets outshined by almost all endgame energy weapons, including Ikelos_SG, The Recluse, Loaded Question, Jötunn, Stubborn Oak, Etc. And no, I’m not calling for any nerfs, because it wouldn’t solve the problems that Oxygen SR3 has and definitely would not make me use it any more than I do now.   Oxygen suffers from 2 Major problems. Being a 180 scout rifle, it lacks that damage needed to reliably get those one taps on most enemies. Oxygen SR3 also suffers from the fact that meganeura and dragonfly take up both of its perks, and both are really lackluster without the use of Dragonfly Spec.   Oxygen SR3 should get the same treatment that Luna’s Howl and NF, make it a precision frame 150 Scout. Instead of it being a nerf like it was to the hand cannons, it would be a buff, since it gains the power and reliability that 150 rpm scouts get, while also keeping the low vertical recoil that comes with 180 scouts. Meganeura and dragon fly should also be merged into one single perk, while also allowing the perk to stack up to 5x rather than 3x. Oxygen SR3 should then either be given outlaw or fourth times the charm in order to further reward precision hits.   Honestly, the Energy Slot is full of a lot of amazing weapons that Oxygen, even with these suggested buffs, will have a hard time competing with. Maybe Oxygen should be switched the the Primary slot, making it the second kinetic weapon to have Firefly/Dragonfly. This would allow it to pair with The Recluse instead of compete with it, and allow for an exotic in the Heavy slot. But these are just my thoughts, and I hope someone at bungie sees this and at least make one of these changes to Oxygen.	https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c7u906/oxygen_sr3_really_is_not_pinnacle_weapon_worthy/		reddit	c7u906	DestinyTheGame	4525.0	4525.0	620.0	Bungie Suggestion

In a meeting with HR today she stated that she didn't want my wife to use her oxygen concentrator in the classroom, that the tube was a hazard. No issue with this was raised last year.   They also said she couldn't use a power wheel chair without a doctor's note. Doc fixed that quickly. Then they objected to the type of chair. She used the chair for distances more than say 100 feet. It also was not an issue previously.   She is approximately four years from retirement and enjoys her job. Seems the new admin wants to force her out and is looking for excuses.
